This is a better archetype, but tbh theyre both SMGs anyway so the damage is terrible either way. You use these SMGs because of their utility. They both have Jolting feedback (which btw is a mag-based hit perk so you want the smallest mag you can get - no Backup Mag mods, no +mag perks), so the main comparison is really in column 1 - and that is basically just a dealers choice between Attrition Orbs or Rolling Storm (which by the way, this perk was always destined to be a left column perk, glad to see it already moved over there). Rolling Storm isnt usually necessary on builds that want Bolt Charge since they have their own ways to get Bolt Charge stacking started and then once it starts stacking you can build it with anything.

Sadly this will struggle when compared to Lost Signal (autoloading holster) and is mostly directly comparable to VS Velocity Baton. A cool weapon and a welcome addition to our arsenals regardless. Blast Distributor is a bit of a sleeper perk here. Big grenade stat bump for one shot is pretty appealing - especially since there really arent many builds that max out grenade stat anyway so this is usually just a high QoL buff that any build should enjoy. The passive energy gain from Blast Distributor should probably outperform demolitionist AND the extra damage you can gain for your grenade by going over 100 is quite welcome.

Similar to the release of rocket sidearms this appears to be incredibly strong. The dps of the weapon appears to not be terrible (avoiding the one weakness of its rocket sidearm brethren) and it is also an absolute unit when doing add clear (though the ammo economy is atrocious - more on that later). Combine all of this with both origin traits being excellent for survivability - if champions/minibosses: problem solver, if no champions/minibosses: vanguard determination. In general, Problem Solver is probably more ideal since in any content where you arent fighting minibosses of any kind this gun is pretty much just overkill anyway. Column 2 is literally stacked top to bottom with good perks for this, with only Elemental Honing being a bit more annoying to use than Bait & Switch and Slice perhaps being redundant paired with the origin traits. In column 1 rewind rounds is pretty much the only real choice. Hatchling could work in a strictly add clear sense, especially when paired with chain reaction, but tbh the gun is probably more suited to bursting down elites and chunking minibosses - especially because it will be great at cleaning red bars no matter what the roll is, so you dont have to feel pinned down to a full add clear roll. A lot of people will prefer One for All here.Usually I would say here that I personally I dont love the ease of use experience of One for All since the buff expires with no way to extend and it ties you down to using just this gun in order to both proc the perk and take advantage of the effect - however, due to the 3 burst and huge blast radius of the shots it is super easy to proc OfA freely on demand for the most part. Master of Arms is a more friendly perk that allows you to use all your weapons and abilities freely, extending the buff freely and only at the cost of some damage. Bait & Switch will likely be the choice if this gun winds up being a legitimate supplemental dps option. We dont yet have extensive testing on how important the Velocity and Blast Radius stats are on this archetype. My assumption is that a healthy mix of both is probably the right call, especially if you can eschew the reload stat by using rewind rounds. Will definitely update this stat section as we learn more.\nNow having some playtime with the gun (my roll is rewind+one for all) it is definitely a cool gun and it feels pretty nice to use. That being said, the ammo economy is a major problem here. Unlike rocket sidearms the gun basically cant be used for clearing red bars at all since it is just a profound waste of ammo. This makes perks like Chain Reaction kinda iffy tbh. Also the gun has so little ammo I cannot imagine it ever really being a feasible supplemental DPS (let alone DPS) option, so those perks are also looking iffy. That all being said, Master of Arms is likely just flat out the top option here since it will allow you to clear adds with your primary and then whip out a buffed rocket pulse to murderize elites/chunk minibosses. In a lot of ideal use case scenarios One for All does seem to function well, since there are a fair number of encounters where packs of elites spawn and thats where this roll would shine. Slice might also be a good play since it just doubles/triples down on the guns utility for survivability. Rewind Rounds is ideal, but tbh it doesnt seem mandatory on a non-DPS roll, which might mean that +mag perks are probably ideal on non-Rewind rolls. Speaking of +mag perks\nFor yet another piece of random esoterica that wound up being very important here, this gun appears to be a linear fusion rifle under the hood, which means that it has inherited the odd behavior of the weapon familys interactions with ammo and reserves. What this means, in practical terms, is that the +mag size you get from the likes of Tactical or Appended Mag (and the backup mag mod) also means that not only do you get an increased magazine size you also get increased reserves AND ammo per brick. This is completely gamechanging for the gun since now with just Tactical Mag you get almost an entire extra magazines worth of ammo at max (which is roughly a ~25% increase in total damage) AND you get an entire extra shot per pickup (going from 2 to 3), which is again a 33% increase in total prospective damage across an encounter. This means that THE ABSOLUTE MOST IMPORTANT PERK on this gun is a mag increase - either Tactical or Appended in general, or Extended if you get Rewind Rounds. And also to note, Backup Mag is all it takes to increase the ammo per brick from 2 to 3, so this gun must always use Backup Mag. Turns out that enhanced Backup Mag (mod that can be added to any t4 or t5 roll) gives the max of 7 in the mag and all the benefits discussed above. This means that the mag column can largely be ignored on a t4/t5 roll with the notable exception being that High-Explosive Ordnance should be avoided like the plague.\nPvE Masterworks: Handling, Blast Radius, Reload, Velocity\nPvE 2 Masterworks: Blast Radius, Velocity, Handling, Reload"},{"hash":42435996,"plugs":[[1478423395,1844523823,373417387,3471392239],[106909392,1087426260,1783397184,1065371964],[3418782618,1563455254],[3081867624,3078487919,4049631843,923806249,2963273944,3744057135,859780267,3422796781]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"spacemonkey/controller/season-27"},{"hash":42435996,"plugs":[[1478423395,1844523823,1441682018,3525010810,3798852852,373417387,3471392239,1639399262,3250572790,582768348],[2420895100,106909392,1087426260,1890997540,1783397184,1065371964],[3418782618,1563455254],[4049631843,3081867624,923806249,3078487919,859780267,2963273944,3422796781,3744057135]],"tags":["PVE"],"originalWishlist":"spacemonkey/controller/season-27"},{"hash":42435996,"plugs":[[1478423395,1844523823,373417387,3471392239],[2420895100,1890997540],[3418782618,1563455254],[4049631843,3081867624,923806249,3078487919,859780267,2963273944,3422796781,3744057135]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"spacemonkey/controller/season-27"},{"hash":1553681400,"plugs":[[4088731040,1890040155,3786062476,4196967425,3128149872,234526563,2953575380,2398680997],[3603807747,1202133695,2955427634,1069117426,2523856971,2181638943,2783367502,2552577806],[951095735,4042220767,3878366039,883665727],[4104185692,1546637391,1089671869,3007133316,3418165135,496047945]],"tags":["PVE"],"originalWishlist":"spacemonkey/controller/season-27","description":"Very unique and interesting weapon. The actual configuration of the gun is pretty random, and mostly determined by the Bolts column. You can make it deal explosive damage to help with add clear, have the bolt itself deal extra damage, have it apply a damage-over-time effect, to name a few. The Rail column mostly just gives nice stats, including the new persistence stat that determines how long the bolts last in the environment before expiring. Unfortunately in the case of the DoT effect from Charged Bolts the Persistence stat does not benefit like it should. It should also be noted that Vorpal seems to be bugged on the gun currently, giving way more damage than it possibly should . Also, bolts can be collected after shooting them (and in the case of Serrated Bolts deals damage when you remove them from an enemy), which means this is a legendary heavy weapon with technically infinite ammo! Explosive Bolts seems to be the best bolt for DPS (buffed by a Hierarchy of Needs ring fwiw, which you can technically make yourself since this bow is legendary).

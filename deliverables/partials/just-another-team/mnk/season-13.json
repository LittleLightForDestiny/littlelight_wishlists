A high range roll with some points into stability is excellent, though if you managed to keep a Bottomless Grief + HIR roll then the 2c1b is nothing to scoff at. With how good Pally’s bases stats are, it would be worth putting some points into stability. It’s so close at base to get the sweet spot of 65-70 stab for a well balanced roll.","hash":1481892490,"name":"","plugs":[[2450788523,1168162263,3643424744,706527188],[2846385770,2213355989]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"description":"","hash":2633186522,"name":"","plugs":[[3643424744],[1683379515,4082225868]],"tags":["PVE","PVP"]},{"description":"","hash":2633186522,"name":"","plugs":[[3643424744,1354429876],[4049631843,1683379515,4082225868,2848615171]],"tags":["PVE"]},{"description":"","hash":2633186522,"name":"","plugs":[[2450788523,3643424744],[4082225868,1683379515,3108830275]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"description":"","hash":2147010335,"name":"","plugs":[[3643424744],[1683379515,4082225868]],"tags":["PVE","PVP"]},{"description":"","hash":2147010335,"name":"","plugs":[[3643424744,1354429876],[4049631843,1683379515,4082225868,2848615171]],"tags":["PVE"]},{"description":"","hash":2147010335,"name":"","plugs":[[2450788523,3643424744],[4082225868,1683379515,3108830275]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"description":"","hash":47772649,"name":"","plugs":[[1168162263,3436462433],[4049631843,1546637391,2848615171]],"tags":["PVE"]},{"description":"","hash":47772649,"name":"","plugs":[[1359896290,2450788523],[1890422124]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"description":"Able to roll both ALH + LI and FP + CC allows two different builds for this gun.

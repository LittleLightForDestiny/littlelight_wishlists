The Finite Impactor while being a Suros hand cannon just doesn't feel as good to me. Cantata-57 feels good, and that's at base. Everything else just builds this gun up to be a beast in PvE content; rivaling even Fatebringer. Ideally you'd want rapid hit and vorpal to cover your majors and minors, but timed payload is a great PvE perk similar to explosive payload. The delay in PvE is negligible and you get nothing but benefits. Rapid hit only works if the bullet portion hits crits but with the aim assist and PvE hit boxes you shouldn't have a horrible time getting rapid hit going.\n\nWhere I've heard the most chatter about the Cantata-57 is from all the PvP players. Having eye of the storm and rangefinder or opening shot is a combo we haven't had since Season of Opulence (rip menagerie, blessed be in our hearts). Eye of the storm and opening shot give you better accuracy for almost your entire gunfight. Whereas rangefinder allows you to comfortably compete with Palindrome. You could also opt for rapid hit to make your consecutive crits easier to hit, or the newly buffed hip-fire grip should you want Under Your Skin levels of spicy. Cantata-57 also completely power crept Annual Skate out of the water by allowing it incredible neutral perks and access to timed payload.

Adaptive munitions is very strong and triple tap once the shield is gone can artificially extend your mag to make it even easier to kill those higher health bar enemies.\n\nIn PvP there isn't as much praise. Perpetual motion will bring up the lower stats to compete with adaptive and precision autos, but lacking a solid damage perk really hinders Come to Pass as a top tier pick. Kill clip or even multikill clip would make it stand out amongst the archetype. Age Old Bond is the only high-impact to get kill clip but comes from the raid.

It has the potential of being really dominant with the right roll and I do think a lot of people are sleeping on it in favor of the Cantata-57 or Palindrome. Having the ability to get rapid hit and the new omolon fluid dynamics origin trait gives Crisis Inverted incredible stability and reload regardless of where you are in the mag and how many stacks of rapid hit you have. Add in damage perks like kill clip, one for all, and vorpal for majors will really put Crisis Inverted over the competition.\n\nWhile Crisis Inverted doesn't have the furthest range even with rangefinder it does have the best ease of use of almost any non-180 hand cannon. Omolon fluid dynamics adds a whopping +20 stability at the top half of the magazine. This puts you right into that 65-75 range of having the best return on your stability and that's just for choosing the omolon trait over the crucible one. Meaning as long as you're diligent in reloading you can keep that buff for every single engagement. You can then invest into range or handling to make the weapon feel perfectly yours.

Where something like the IKELOS_SR_v1.0.2 has great boss dealing capabilities, it is also hard to get. Fugue-55 also released this season has similar boss killing capabilities, but is just as hard to get. Father's Sins is craftable but doesn't offer as much. Focused Fury is great for choosing when to get your damage and being able to reload and triple tap into a bigger mag is a huge boon. But damage phases are moving to more mobile sets, so \"stand and DPS\" is becoming less common. Even still having one in the event a \"stand and DPS\" phase comes back would be nice to keep in your back pocket.\n\nSimilarly Father's Sins is weird in PvP. Lower zoom snipers did just get a small buff to their aim assist cones, and Father's Sins is a 35 zoom sniper. That being said, it doesn't immediately make them good, nor does it make them bad. Most people have shifted towards higher zooms, namely 45 and 50 zooms. The two things that can bump up Father's Sins in my book is the ease of getting one and crafting it to your liking, as well as having access to under pressure and opening shot. With a higher base aim assist than the likes of Occluded Finality and Shephard's Watch it could see some use being the bullet bending sniper.

Higher base zoom than the rest of its archetype, only being surpassed by False Promises. Herod-C does have better base stats almost entirely across the board for the archetype. Where it lacks in some categories it blows out the competition in others. With such a slow rate of fire you won't have to spec as hard into stability to keep the bullets going where you want them to go. Also having the highest stability of its class helps that out too. When it comes to perks Arrowhead will be the play. Bumping fully automatic weapons to 100 recoil direction with a decent amount of handling added will just make your end result an easy shooting experience. Appended mag will help bring up its already high magazine size, but you could opt for armor-piercing rounds for general utility against shields. The trait perks also work in different ways as well. One way you can spec your Herod-C is to create a pseudo-mag through subsistence and demolitionist; or you could breach and clear using subsistence and headstone to rip through groups of enemies; if bosses are your bread and butter having more damage against them and ammo back through fourth time's the charm can also leverage the high damage and magazine Herod-C can provide you.\n\nHigh Impacts have never been high meta within PvP. Taking their slower rate of fire, as well as crit to body damage, and adding in the requirement of having constant line of sight leaves a lot to be desired. But you can make this weapon work for you if you bring up some of its low points. The recoil has to be 100 through Arrowhead Brake to make your life easier. Taking the combination of perpetual motion and tap the trigger also makes shots easier for you. The final bit to add is extra flinch for your enemies via high-caliber rounds."},{"hash":1788603939,"plugs":[[839105230],[1087426260],[1820235745],[124408337]],"tags":["GodPVE"]},{"hash":1788603939,"plugs":[[839105230,1482024992,1392496348],[1561002382,1885400500],[1428297954,1359896290],[1890422124,3523296417,588594999]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"hash":1788603939,"plugs":[[839105230],[1561002382],[1428297954],[1890422124]],"tags":["GodPVP"]},{"hash":3428521585,"plugs":[[839105230,1840239774],[106909392,1087426260,2420895100],[2848615171,3523296417,247725512,169755979,1906147653,2938480696],[1546637391,1048183818,11612903,3418165135,3431277734,2422968039]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"I'm glad to see more aggressive burst pulse rifles, but I am not glad to see more raid aggressive burst pulse rifles.

Both with elemental capacitor and quick charge hit 100 handling. Which can further be boosted by steady hands or perpetual motion. Which means you can completely forego handling in favor of more range for deeper clean ups. Range does not increase your one hit kill range, but will make it more consistent in those further ranges when needing slight damage.

It's almost a better Chroma Rush for majors while still having good utility in general content. This allows you to expand your loadouts and flex into kinetic (or stasis) special weapons while still having that good bullet hose in your back pocket. You seriously need to clean up the recoil direction so I think arrowhead brake is a must-have on any Sweet Sorrow you do end up keeping. A recoil direction stat of 57 is just far too low. Ideally the +45 from arrowhead brake and a counterbalance mod would be the best choice but I know that minor spec or backup mag would be the better choice for most users. Triple tap and vorpal weapon together can help you shred some majors or champions, but the overall lower base damage leans me to recommending other weapons specifically for major killing. You can make it work but it's not ideal.\n\nThis is a fun situation where PvE and PvP mix. Arrowhead brake is still the best barrel, and I would recommend a counterbalance mod to get that recoil to 100 and give you the ease of use to invest into range or more consistency perks. The \"big\" damage perks on Sweet Sorrow don't lend themselves to the PvP landscape, but one could argue demolitionist is a lethality perk, especially with current Void 3.0 grenades. Truthfully I'd try and make this weapon as consistent as physically possible and spec fully into stability. Autos are not in the best place, especially with their requirement of time-on-target for optimal TtK.

The unfortunate part is no rapid hit to maximize the weapons feel, but it does have some incredible utility with stasis builds and general crystal shattering.\n\nIf one pulse screamed consistency this pulse would do it. PvP falls into one of two categories. Consistency or lethality. Syncopation doesn't have anything to push it into the 2 burst realm outside of person buffs (empowering rift, inertia override, etc) but it does have utter consistency.

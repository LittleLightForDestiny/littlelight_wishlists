We have gotten a few new aggressive frame shotguns recently, especially within this DLC. The interesting thing about this shotgun is the inclusion of Nanotech Tracer Rockets pushes this shotgun a little over the edge compared to its brothers and sisters.

If you are using Basso Ostinato as a DPS weapon or mob killer, then something like Trench Barrel or Destabilizing Rounds will be perfect with Envious Assassin. If you punch a lot you can pair Grave Robber with either of the punchy perks.\n\nBasso Ostinato does not compete well in PvP. Opening Shot does make up one of the two incredible shotgun perks. However, Perpetual Motion does not stack up as well compared to Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion 2x is still not even as strong of a handling buff as Threat Detector 1x.

They just feel so good to use. Omolon Fluid Dynamics aside, these have always been one of my favorite classes of sidearms. Being that Senuna SI6 is stasis, the best perk for it is Headstone. Being able to slow and deal AoE damage off of a single kill is extremely strong. We all know how strong Disorienting Grenades are. Slow is just a different version of that. I don't have to tell you all that. Feeding Frenzy is your best bet if you are \"maining\" this sidearm, but Envious Assassin could be fun. I don't love it on primary ammo weapons as you should be using these the most, but depending on your build you could be swapping more than me. Another great perk to look out for is Golden Tricorn. Less useful if you don't use Stasis, but extremely strong now with our current surge mods.\n\nSenuna SI6 is arguably the best three-burst sidearm. Slickdraw gives you 100 handling. A counterbalance mod gives you 99 recoil direction. You can then invest entirely into range as Omolon Fluid Dynamics will give you your stability. The only issue is the fourth column perk. Headstone is great in 3v3. Elemental Capacitor can bump up your stability on void, or forgo a counterbalance mod on Stasis. If you jump a lot then Strand could be a great option for you. Headseeker is another good option. Ideally I would run Headstone just for locking down that position and having some cover as well.

Heck yeah boi. Definitely go for Arrowhead Brake so you have a decent recoil direction. Lightweight scouts don't need much but anything helps. Tactical Mag or Appended Mag are going to be the best here. Small shout out to Flared Magwell, but with Outlaw you won't need a lot of reload. I'd take more bullets for this one.\n\nPvP (Controller): Moving Target is arguably the best in slot for the third column, and kill clip will allow for some spicy three taps. Definitely keep an eye out for this one. Again Arrowhead Brake is recommended for allowing you to focus less on controlling the recoil and more about crits. Steady Rounds will bump up the stability meaning you have less jump each shot. You shouldn't have to worry about the range drop as scouts have different metrics for range. Handling or stability for masterwork depending on how fast you like your weapons.\n\nPvP (MnK): Similar to the controller recommendation, except it has Accurized Rounds.

Surrounded is the best damage perk for running into a group of enemies, and threat detector just enhances stats. Nothing like immediate damage.\n\nPvP (Controller): This is the best version of the title we have seen. This almost competes with the like of Shayura's Tarrabah, IKELOS and Immortal. No adept mods, not the best range, but having rangefinder is an incredible bonus. Dynamic Sway Reduction is icing on the Title's cake for allowing a smooth shooting experience.\n\nPvP (MnK): The Title doesn't need much to be a powerhouse in this meta. Rangefinder on a 750 is enough. But allowing you to duel multiple enemies within quick succession is another thing entirely. Without offering damage in the way of Kill Clip, the Title does give you Offhand Strike to take on multiple opponents while keeping your strafe speed up.

It has that inflated perk pool like all core playlist weapons. That being said, there's a ton of incredible perks you can choose from. With the recent-ish change of resets adding more perks it will be really easy to get your god roll or at least a usable roll. For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you'd have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you're continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three.\n\nFor PvP it is a decent zoom high-impact frame. You can make a choice between opening shot or snapshot if you crank up the handling high enough. Elemental capacitor will certainly help with that. Perpetual motion and moving target are also both incredible perks on snipers, one boosting low stats, the other adding forgiveness through aim assist."},{"hash":676270382,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1087426260],[3400784728,573122728],[1771339417,395388285]],"tags":["GodPVE"]},{"hash":676270382,"plugs":[[1840239774,4090651448],[3142289711],[588594999,3511092054,1428297954,2717805783,711234314,2014892510],[957782887,47981717,4116820839,1370847713]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"hash":676270382,"plugs":[[1840239774],[3142289711],[588594999,2717805783],[957782887,4116820839]],"tags":["GodPVP"]},{"hash":963710795,"plugs":[[839105230],[689005463,2680121939,1483536627],[1523832109,1820235745],[2978966579,2610012052,3523296417]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Oh this is a spicy roll. Reconstruction and chill clip are so strong together. Subsistence is another good shout if you know you'll secure the kill. I think dropping the charge time as a quality of life perk will make the whole experience better, but if you are okay with the charge time normally, you can go for a larger magazine.\n\nIn PvP there aren't a lot of pros for high-impact fusions. They are certainly strong and they are my favorites to use. But the charge time increase really hurt their overall utility. The change to 5 bolts was nice, but not having high-impact reserves in this weapons perk pool is a bit of a let down. Elemental capacitor can make it feel super consistent on void, arc or stasis.

Avalanche is just a relic of year 3. It's a weird SUROS machine gun that fires from both barrels. The saving grace is being a 450 RPM machine gun. I went slightly different with my recommendations compared to my peers. With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have. With auto-loading holster you won't have to worry about reload speed and you'll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there's target lock. This season's newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75. With these many bullets you should definitely be the coolest person in your fireteam when you hit the cap on damage and be able to show off that sweet, sweet DEEPS.\n\nAdaptive machine guns have always been my favorite for PvP. Being able to have decent damage at range, good chip damage, and a pretty manageable recoil are all great things to have. Avalanche does bring some good things to the table, like maxing out recoil direction with arrowhead brake. Ricochet rounds gives you some much needed stability. Dynamic sway reduction will reduce your bloom on extended gunfights. On MnK I would recommend swashbuckler or adrenaline junkie for a flat damage bonus. On Controller I would recommend tap the trigger for even more stability. Not all of it is needed, but having a gun you don't have to fight will make your job easier and you can focus on your opponent."},{"hash":495940989,"plugs":[[839105230],[1087426260],[3300816228,3528046508],[365154968,2939589096]],"tags":["GodPVE"]},{"hash":495940989,"plugs":[[839105230],[1885400500],[1359896290,3060983774],[4082225868,11612903,1161469972,2422968039]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"hash":495940989,"plugs":[[839105230],[1885400500],[1359896290,3060983774],[4082225868,1161469972]],"tags":["GodPVP"]},{"hash":1903182562,"plugs":[[3525010810,1441682018,3798852852],[3796465595,2985827016],[2869569095,3523296417,2010801679,2308090567,1906147653,3797647183],[4104185692,3927722942,2396489472,3007133316,1167468626,598607952]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Blowout will be an alright addition to your arsenal.

With the return of the Ikelos SMG this season (and its craftable), Blood Feud last season, the Extraordinary Rendition before that and the Ikelos v2 even further back. The Cold Front just has poor stats across the board. With the lowest stability in its class, the lowest reload and aim assist. Cold Front is tied for the lowest magazine with Blood Feud. Cold Front needs a lot to make it feel and shoot well. In PvE I would recommend corkscrew rifling to give a flat buff to all its stats. Flared magwell offers the best of both reload and stability (two stats this gun desperately needs). Frenzy and Subsistence are my final choices. Frenzy is the best for bringing up even more of Cold Front's poor stats. Subsistence has received multiple buffs and it feels incredible on your primary add clear weapon. It's a good thing no matter what you will look cool shooting this gun.\n\nIt's a similar situation in PvP. Cold Front has a giant hill to climb and with a lot of competition it might not be worth it. Most people have Blood Feud from last season, and the Ikelos SMG just received a pretty nice upgrade. Cold Front does have the best sights IMO so for me it's semi-worth. In PvP you're really looking for consistency or lethality. Cold Front does not have super strong lethality perks like kill clip or multikill clip, so you're looking for consistency. Cold Front does offer rangefinder, putting it on par with its siblings, but the lack of stats still leaves a lot to be desired. Perpetual motion, tap the trigger, smallbore, and stability are all very important stats to look into. With the Ikelos SMG having eighteen more stability at base, you will need all the help you can get."},{"hash":2814093983,"plugs":[[4090651448],[3230963543],[1820235745],[4104185692]],"tags":["GodPVE"]},{"hash":2814093983,"plugs":[[3250034553],[3142289711],[1428297954],[2846385770]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"hash":2814093983,"plugs":[[3250034553],[3142289711],[1428297954],[2846385770]],"tags":["GodPVP"]},{"hash":540880995,"plugs":[[839105230],[106909392,1087426260,3230963543],[1820235745],[2173046394,2610012052,2848615171]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Oh dark decider. I am happy to see you. I do not know what it is about the Veist style rapid fire frames, but I vastly prefer them over non-Veist ones. Dark Decider is almost a carbon copy of my favorite rapid fire frame of all time Hollow Earth from Year 1. Subsistence and voltshot are going to be the roll to get on Dark Decider for PvE. Golden tricorn is fantastic but requires a bit more thinking to maintain 2x.\n\nFor PvP Dark Decider fits into a weird spot. It has some of the lowest base stats within its archetypes but some of the most unique perks that can put it well above the rest. For one, it is the only rapid-fire frame to roll rangefinder. Putting it in a range class well above its stats. It can also roll Iron Grip for a whopping +20 stability without sacrificing your barrel and magazine perks to stability. The only other auto rifle in this class to compete with Dark Decider would be Krait and given comparable rolls (DD - hammer-forged, accurized, iron grip, rangefinder / K - hammer-forged, ricochet, overflow, moving target) Dark Decider would have 2 whole meters over Krait.

A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight and oh gosh my bees are kneed (I know that's not how that goes). There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a \"no thoughts, head empty\" workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun.\n\nTaking that fantastic base and transitioning it over to the crucible is easy. Most of the weapon stays the same. Arrowhead and rapid hit are the foundation. Steady rounds for more stability, or accurized rounds for even more range is your preference. In the last column you have three separate ways you can go. Kill clip is the easiest to use and helps make the second kill easier as you won't need as many critical hits. Headseeker is my pick for overall neutral play.

I grinded for one back in 2020 and loved the scope and the way it feels. In 2021 its perk pool was updated and now in 2022 we again grind for a newer, more updateder version of the 2021 roll. Arrowhead brake is the best thing for these dawning weapons. Maxing out recoil direction will just make the shooting experience easier. Not having to think about recoil control just means you can focus on how cool this gun is.

Not needing to think about how many shots of reservoir burst you have left and instead going 1:1 makes things easier. Easy is good. I will also give a special shoutout to Golden tricorn. SImilar to Stay Frosty, having the ability cycling and one of the highest damage outputs you can imagine for this weapon type is incredible. Void also gives you more ways of uptime and refresh-ability. Definitely keep an eye out for that.\n\nIn PvP it's all about stacking as many consistency perks as possible.

Jokes aside, it is really cool to see a new lightweight \"kinetic\" pulse rifle. Its base stats aren't anything to write home about. Tied for stability with Ogma PR6, and Chattering Bone at 52, it also ties the Ogma in range but beats Chattering Bone. Stay Frosty also has the lowest handling, aim assist, and \"magazine\" (it's at 31, Ogma at 32, and Chattering at 33, but they're all three-round pulses. Take that for what you want). It's definitely a little outclassed within the stat department. Where Stay Frosty takes the lead is in its perks. Arrowhead is a must regardless of what activity you're in. Having a base recoil of 55 means you can slap on a CB mod and be at 100. Thresh is an incredible tool for building your supers now that your intellect stat doesn't matter as much compared to whatever tier you're in. Headstone is just fun add clear. Get a crit on a thrall? It's no longer a thrall but a thrallsicle! (I'll see myself out). Short shout-out to Golden tricorn. Golden tricorn is the best for ability cycling and weapon cycling. Being able to have such a huge refreshable buff that stacks with things like elemental wells, high-energy fire, and radiance is too good to pass up. Stasis isn't the strongest on its own for abilities, but it might get a buff. Who knows.\n\nOver in the crucible 450 pulses just aren't anything important. Messenger exists, and the new hotness is Disparity. Stay Frosty has a lot to build up in order to compete. Arrowhead brake is a must, but smallbore is a decent alternative if you're fine with the lower recoil direction. Ricochet rounds brings up the stability and bumps up the range a smidge. Over on MnK I would recommend killing wind for the bump in range, handling and movement speed. Couple that with desperado and you've got a pretty solid roll for going on sprees. On Controller I would recommend something slightly different. Moving target is the only perk I would change. Moving target gives you aim assist and movement speed neutrally.

Every roll has chambered compensator and flared magwell for better recoil and better reload and stability. Repulsor brace is the only let down for me. If you are a void subclass main, it can be incredible to have a 45 health overshield on demand but having to stay on void lets it down a little bit. Neutrally, tunnel vision is easy to proc and you don't have to think about it at all or set your subclass for it to work. If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you'll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can't get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory.\n\nVeles-X will still have some incredible usefulness in PvP as well. Tunnel vision and kill clip are perfect with one another. At base you have an incredible pulse that can two burst. With kill clip it makes that two burst more forgiving but you also have tunnel vision for more aim assist. With the recent change to kill clip and tunnel vision, both can be refreshed so it keeps both perks active whenever you get a kill."},{"hash":2276328320,"plugs":[[3661387068],[3230963543],[776531651],[2610012052]],"tags":["GodPVE"]},{"hash":2276328320,"plugs":[[3661387068],[3230963543],[2946784966],[1015611457]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"hash":2276328320,"plugs":[[3661387068],[3230963543],[2946784966],[1015611457]],"tags":["GodPVP"]},{"hash":3183283212,"plugs":[[3525010810,1441682018,3798852852],[3032599245,3301904089],[2396489472,3300816228,2869569095],[4104185692,2610012052,3194351027]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Wendigo is back!

With a linear fusion rifle nerf incoming we might see a rise in grenade launcher usage. With Wendigo being at the top of the list. Spike will give you damage, but better utility might be blinding. If you want to go all into damage, spike grenades, golden tricorn, adept big ones, and font of might will give you some incredible damage output. It's a lot harder to upkeep on a grenade launcher, and especially when you're dealing with a boss with limited fodder you might not be able to sustain golden tricorn 2x. Even with that set up you will have some great burst damage.\n\nWendigo is interesting in PvP. I wouldn't use it, but I also wouldn't be upset with someone if they did. It has utility and it can work similar to other grenade launchers. Proximity grenades adds forgiveness and flexibility. Impulse amplifier makes it more of a pocket rocket launcher, and rangefinder will just make whatever arc the grenade has minimal. Another good shout is explosive light. If you hold onto your explosive light shots, or build it up without having power ammo, you will have even more flexibility with the added damage, and be able to counter supers with ease."},{"hash":3183283212,"plugs":[[3525010810],[3032599245],[2396489472],[4104185692]],"tags":["GodPVE"]},{"hash":3183283212,"plugs":[[3525010810,3798852852,3809316345],[409831596],[951095735],[2846385770,3194351027]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"hash":3183283212,"plugs":[[3525010810],[409831596],[951095735],[2846385770]],"tags":["GodPVP"]},{"hash":555148853,"plugs":[[3525010810,1441682018,3798852852],[3032599245,3301904089],[2396489472,3300816228,2869569095],[4104185692,2610012052,3194351027]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Wendigo is back!

Similar to Warden's Law it fires two grenades at once. This does mean that the grenades can split off and you'd only be doing half damage. The double grenades do have two impact damages which does put them ahead of regular grenade launchers. Auto-loading holster is still the best for fire-and-forget. Disruption break is always going to be a strong pick, especially on impacts for demolishing shields. Frenzy and vorpal can work if you're primarily going to be using Wilderflight as your main source of damage instead of setting up yourself or your team for kinetic damage.\n\nI don't know how to feel about Wilderflight in PvP. Technically you can do more damage with double impact, and have some forgiveness with proximity grenades. But it also means that the architecture can really mess you up if you go to bounce shot and it splits the grenades into two different directions. I have yet to fully test out the full damage of each grenade, but disruption break will still probably be then play. Being able to hit one grenade and break a shield will give your kinetic 50% more damage which will definitely drop any guardian with ease."},{"hash":2306182339,"plugs":[[3525010810],[3032599245],[3300816228],[1683379515]],"tags":["GodPVE"]},{"hash":2306182339,"plugs":[[3525010810,3798852852,3809316345],[409831596,2822142346],[3300816228,3523296417],[1683379515,691659142,11612903]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"hash":2306182339,"plugs":[[3525010810],[409831596],[3300816228],[1683379515]],"tags":["GodPVP"]},{"hash":396910433,"plugs":[[3666208348],[269888150],[3108830275,855168139],[2396489472,598607952]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Zephyr was my favorite looking sword (right up until Hero of Ages released).

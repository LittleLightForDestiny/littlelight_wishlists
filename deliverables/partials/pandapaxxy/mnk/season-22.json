Being able to have Overflow and One-Two Punch for the highest damage show followed by the most One-Two Punch...punches. The only other synergy you could have asked for is Grave Robber for instant refresh on melee kills. However, on bigger bosses that might need a few more hits than your magazine allows this could slot in perfectly. Being Arc it also has some synergy with the Hunter class and can play into blinding / amplified builds. Discord is another interesting shout as you can run around with Frenzy for full uptime on damage and always having ammo to shoot with. Barrel Constrictor is an interesting perk for PvE as it makes sure all your pellets hit but it would be better paired with One-Two Punch instead of in the same column.\n\nI'm not going to lie. I got excited by this shotgun for one mere fact. Slickdraw. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it has been mine for the past season. I have been slowly collecting Slickdraw weapons and changing crafted weapons to utilize Slickdraw. Now I know Slickdraw reduces your auto-aim cone size; it just means you have to be a bit more accurate when aiming. You can achieve a similar effect of Slickdraw by going with Arc Elemental Capacitor, Barrel Shroud, a Handling MW, and Quick Access Sling for 96 handling. This gives you a ready speed of 0.20s and an aim down sights speed of 0.23s. However just having Slickdraw drops you to the same ready speed and drops a hundredth of a second off of aim down sights. This means you can invest every other stat point into range. Bungie knew what they were doing when bringing in this weapon as Deadpan Delivery has the second lowest range stat of all Aggressive Frame shotguns even losing to the Uncommon Ded Nemoris II.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Handling"},{"hash":1296429091,"plugs":[[1300023272],[1087426260],[3643424744],[2679249093]],"tags":["GodPVE"]},{"hash":1296429091,"plugs":[[1482024992,1300023272],[3142289711,791862061],[3511092054,1821614984],[1451849462,2450788523]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"hash":1296429091,"plugs":[[1482024992],[3142289711],[3511092054],[1451849462]],"tags":["GodPVP"]},{"hash":105306149,"plugs":[[839105230,3661387068,1482024992],[1087426260,3230963543],[2621346526,744594675,1570042021,2495011826,2139363611,2748258257],[2610012052,365154968,11612903,4290541820,2939589096,2422968039]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"I am sure by now most players have a good rapid-fire machine gun in their arsenal.

Eleatic has access to Golden Tricorn which is the best damage perk in the game, or if you prefer not to use an arc subclass you could go with Target Lock for a slightly different Retrofit.

Well, in PvE not a whole lot. If you're constantly cycling debuffs it could be interesting, but not all subclasses have equal access to debuffs. Void warlock and hunter could be the strongest uptime with child and the smoke bomb applying debuffs. Otherwise I think this perk is mostly useless. It then leaves us with a dilemma; what is the best PvE perk on Kept Confidence for PvE? Stats for All is probably going to be your best bet. It leaves a lot to be desired, but is the best we can do.

Neither are exceptionally better than the other, but the main pairing for both is Eye of the Storm.

With a recoil direction of 56 you almost need Arrowhead Brake in order to fire at full RPM. In PvE I would highly recommend Flared Magwell or Light Mag depending on if you want range or stability. The added reload will feel incredible. You can then stack on Outlaw or Enlightened Action for better reload on top of that, or even Keep Away to bump out your range and handling. I find that in certain activities it is hard to keep enemies away all the time so you'll be constantly fighting whether the perk is up or not. Finally to round out the reload / damage perks you can use the easiest damage Nightshade has to offer, Collective Action. I find Kill Clip to be better as it's an ever so slightly higher damage bump. But depending on your build if you can create those elemental pickups it would be easier on Collective Action. Hatchling could work really well on Strand now that they received a slight buff.\n\nNightshade in PvP has had an interesting run. From being a viable option in Vanilla, to being passed over with random rolls, to being an off meta choice in its revival, to being outclassed, and finally returning again. What a ride. Arrowhead Brake is again my choice in barrels, but if you can control the recoil direction you can certainly opt for other options. Ricochet Rounds is the best in slot whenever it is available so please choose that. High-Caliber Rounds can work but I find neutrally the bump in stability outweighs possibly flinching off my opponent. In the third column it is all about Keep Away. Being able to get a range bump for free is incredible. I prefer Kill Clip for an easier time 1v2'ing as I am usually in a bad situation, but Headseeker is better neutrally for any 1vX situation as it's always on.

But it is now another high-impact scout with Kill Clip.\nMasterworks: PvE: Handling PvP: Handling"},{"hash":1161561386,"plugs":[[839105230],[1087426260],[3523296417],[555281244]],"tags":["GodPVE"]},{"hash":1161561386,"plugs":[[1840239774,1482024992,4090651448],[1885400500,1561002382],[3828510309,3523296417,1428297954],[1015611457,11612903]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"hash":1161561386,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1885400500],[3828510309],[1015611457]],"tags":["GodPVP"]},{"hash":1999754402,"plugs":[[1482024992,4090651448,1840239774],[3230963543,679225683,106909392],[3643424744,1631667848],[3891536761,365154968,4082225868]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"The Showrunner returns to us in an interesting time. I know I will be using it but that's because it can roll with an ever so elusive combination of Grave Robber and Swashbuckler. The Showrunner being the second lightweight frame with this combo and the first in the Kinetic Slot. For me this works well with all my titan builds and my titan brain. However, if you're not on a punch subclass or the master class then opting for something like Overflow and Kinetic Tremors will be a great combo. Overflow allows you to get 72 bullets per magazine, allowing for a whopping 7 Kinetic Tremor activations; and that's just at base. The only other weapon to get this combination is Buzzard but the lower magazine on Buzzard really holds it back, only getting 3 per overflow. This doesn't mean you can't get more than that by constantly walking over bricks to refill the magazine, but let's be honest I haven't done that subconsciously and I love Overflow.\n\nIn PvP The Showrunner is going to be the least used SMG this season right behind Unending Tempest. Go see why I think that SMG is better in the Vendor breakdown. The Showrunner has some great perks in Target Lock and Dynamic Sway Reduction, Rangefinder if you're really looking for consistency at range, or more neutral perks like Well Rounded or Heating Up. However, the issue is really the frame we were given. Lightweight SMGs are not \"in the spotlight.\" While I think this SMG can serve you well as a kinetic Funnelweb the perks to note aren't as strong. You can almost hit 100 range with Full Bore, Ricochet, Well Rounded 2x, and Fragile Focus, but that sacrifices Target Lock and Dynamic Sway Reduction for only 23m of range.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Range"},{"hash":1999754402,"plugs":[[1482024992],[3230963543],[3643424744],[3891536761]],"tags":["GodPVE"]},{"hash":1999754402,"plugs":[[1840239774,3250034553,1467527085],[1885400500,1561002382,679225683],[1359896290,3643424744,2846385770],[365154968,2451262963,4082225868]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"hash":1999754402,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1885400500],[1359896290],[365154968]],"tags":["GodPVP"]},{"hash":2510526114,"plugs":[[1482024992,4090651448],[1087426260,106909392,3230963543],[3523296417,3828510309,1820235745],[11612903,124408337,4104185692]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Another season, another bajillion perks in our core weapons. Unending Tempest comes in as the first core playlist 600 rpm submachine gun. We have had Aggressives come from Crucible and Gambit. Lightweights from Crucible and Vanguard. So no Precision Frames. The biggest synergy is Demolitionist and Adrenaline Junkie. Enlightened Action and any damage bonus will also feel incredible. And of course there's Subsistence and Frenzy for damage and never having to reload.\n\nUnending Tempest will be the next best submachine gun. Rivaling but not as strong as release The Immortal. The only issue is the large perk pool, but you can always work around that by playing crucible for more resets. The best perks depend on how you play. Killing Wind will help you get to and beat out your next engagement, Multikill Clip works here, but Kill Clip would have been better. Dynamic Sway Reduction will help keep your bullets on target paired with Target Lock for that quick TtK. Finally you could also try to hit max range with Fragile Focus and boost up your other stats with Perpetual Motion. It's definitely going to be a dominant SMG this season, and if you prefer precision SMGs like myself it will be worth the grind.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Range"},{"hash":2510526114,"plugs":[[1482024992],[1087426260],[3523296417],[11612903]],"tags":["GodPVE"]},{"hash":2510526114,"plugs":[[3250034553,1482024992],[3142289711],[2450788523,1428297954,1359896290],[365154968,2458213969,2451262963]],"tags":["PVP"]},{"hash":2510526114,"plugs":[[3250034553],[3142289711],[2450788523],[365154968]],"tags":["GodPVP"]},{"hash":1821529912,"plugs":[[1482024992,4090651448,1840239774],[1087426260,106909392,3230963543],[1354429876,3828510309],[1546637391,4104185692]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Warden's Law got a buff recently and allows it to feel more like a hybrid Crimson.

The Finite Impactor while being a Suros hand cannon just doesn't feel as good to me. Cantata-57 feels good, and that's at base. Everything else just builds this gun up to be a beast in PvE content; rivaling even Fatebringer. Ideally you'd want rapid hit and vorpal to cover your majors and minors, but timed payload is a great PvE perk similar to explosive payload. The delay in PvE is negligible and you get nothing but benefits. Rapid hit only works if the bullet portion hits crits but with the aim assist and PvE hit boxes you shouldn't have a horrible time getting rapid hit going.\n\nWhere I've heard the most chatter about the Cantata-57 is from all the PvP players. Having eye of the storm and rangefinder or opening shot is a combo we haven't had since Season of Opulence (rip menagerie, blessed be in our hearts). Eye of the storm and opening shot give you better accuracy for almost your entire gunfight. Whereas rangefinder allows you to comfortably compete with Palindrome.

Omolon fluid dynamics adds a whopping +20 stability at the top half of the magazine. This puts you right into that 65-75 range of having the best return on your stability and that's just for choosing the omolon trait over the crucible one. Meaning as long as you're diligent in reloading you can keep that buff for every single engagement. You can then invest into range or handling to make the weapon feel perfectly yours.

Where something like the IKELOS_SR_v1.0.2 has great boss dealing capabilities, it is also hard to get. Fugue-55 also released this season has similar boss killing capabilities, but is just as hard to get. Father's Sins is craftable but doesn't offer as much. Focused Fury is great for choosing when to get your damage and being able to reload and triple tap into a bigger mag is a huge boon. But damage phases are moving to more mobile sets, so \"stand and DPS\" is becoming less common. Even still having one in the event a \"stand and DPS\" phase comes back would be nice to keep in your back pocket.\n\nSimilarly Father's Sins is weird in PvP. Lower zoom snipers did just get a small buff to their aim assist cones, and Father's Sins is a 35 zoom sniper. That being said, it doesn't immediately make them good, nor does it make them bad. Most people have shifted towards higher zooms, namely 45 and 50 zooms. The two things that can bump up Father's Sins in my book is the ease of getting one and crafting it to your liking, as well as having access to under pressure and opening shot. With a higher base aim assist than the likes of Occluded Finality and Shephard's Watch it could see some use being the bullet bending sniper.

Appended mag will help bring up its already high magazine size, but you could opt for armor-piercing rounds for general utility against shields. The trait perks also work in different ways as well. One way you can spec your Herod-C is to create a pseudo-mag through subsistence and demolitionist; or you could breach and clear using subsistence and headstone to rip through groups of enemies; if bosses are your bread and butter having more damage against them and ammo back through fourth time's the charm can also leverage the high damage and magazine Herod-C can provide you.\n\nHigh Impacts have never been high meta within PvP.

It's almost a better Chroma Rush for majors while still having good utility in general content. This allows you to expand your loadouts and flex into kinetic (or stasis) special weapons while still having that good bullet hose in your back pocket. You seriously need to clean up the recoil direction so I think arrowhead brake is a must-have on any Sweet Sorrow you do end up keeping. A recoil direction stat of 57 is just far too low. Ideally the +45 from arrowhead brake and a counterbalance mod would be the best choice but I know that minor spec or backup mag would be the better choice for most users. Triple tap and vorpal weapon together can help you shred some majors or champions, but the overall lower base damage leans me to recommending other weapons specifically for major killing. You can make it work but it's not ideal.\n\nThis is a fun situation where PvE and PvP mix. Arrowhead brake is still the best barrel, and I would recommend a counterbalance mod to get that recoil to 100 and give you the ease of use to invest into range or more consistency perks. The \"big\" damage perks on Sweet Sorrow don't lend themselves to the PvP landscape, but one could argue demolitionist is a lethality perk, especially with current Void 3.0 grenades. Truthfully I'd try and make this weapon as consistent as physically possible and spec fully into stability.

Wait. That's not entirely true. The Gambit focus weapon this season is called Dead Weight. Rapid-fire shotguns have always been my favorite for one-two punch builds. One-two punch doesn't really rely on the damage from the shotgun as your melee is then increased by 200% (80% with Liar's Handshake). So you don't really have to invest as heavily into any one stat. Range is negligible as you will be barrel stuffing a boss to be within melee range. Stability doesn't really matter on shotguns in general. Handling does help to make follow up shots a little faster. And with grave robber you can completely ignore the reload stat. Any mag boosting perk brings you right to the magazine cap of 8. So really any other perks just benefit the shotgun to make it feel better. If you dislike one-two punch (how dare you) there's plenty of other alternative combinations like swashbuckler and subsistence for keeping the damage going, or subsistence and adrenaline junkie for grenade focused builds. If you prefer a more pocket shotgun feel then auto-loading holster is the best in slot.\n\nRapid-fire shotguns do not fare so well in PvP compared to PvE. Full choke is still mandatory to secure the best possibility for a two-tap kill. Accurized rounds pushes out the fall off so you'd still be able to do that solid 1 damage at 3m and beyond. Perpetual motion brings up the already healthy handling. Where Dead Weight falls off hard is in the final column. Not having access to some of the top tier perks like opening shot or even elemental capacitor to max out the range adds to the downfall of this shotgun.

Both of the 900 rpm smgs just pump out damage faster, and aggressive frames hit like a truck while still maintaining a lot of that spray. Precision frames have the best base range for all smgs but comically low handling, reload, and stability. All three of which are important in PvE activities. Reload especially. Enyo-D comes equipped with feeding frenzy to circumvent the low reload, and fluted barrel will bump up that low handling. I like surrounded with surrounded spec for the best damage, but multikill clip coupled with feeding frenzy is a great option too.\n\nWhere I've heard the most chatter around Enyo-D is in the Crucible. People are calling it the Antiope-D 2.0 or the kinetic Shayura's Wrath. I think both are true, but the Enyo-D still has some shortcomings when it comes to comparing against the both.

I originally thought I would love it back in opulence, but the nature and rpm of the high-impact frame machine guns makes them feel so slow. To make Fixed Odds feel a little less slow, run either arrowhead brake for the recoil direction or fluted barrel to bring up one of its worst stats. Any mag boosting perk is preferred in the second column. Feeding frenzy or field prep will depend on how you play, but both bring up another low stat. Finally depending on how you play, killing tally, firing line, or incandescent are all fantastic perks. If you're using a Solar 3.0 subclass, incandescent and feeding frenzy make a great pairing. If you prefer any other subclass and are solo, killing tally will be phenomenal. Finally if you run group activities a lot, firing line and field prep will be excellent for boss or major dps.\n\nHigh-Impact machine guns in PvP are not the first choice, and really not even the second or third choice either. Their TtK is competitive, but their forgiveness and ease of use is not. Arrowhead brake really cleans up the recoil and will make follow up shots a lot easier to hit. Pair that with accurized rounds to extend your engagement range. Finally, because of the nature of heavy ammo in PvP, you'll be happy to grab a roll with under pressure for the added accuracy and stability.

Both have the stopping power of buffed desperado, but having vorpal for majors and champs is a bonus in New Purpose's corner.\n\nIn terms of PvP it's really close. Rapid hit and the adept mods to give a small edge to messenger, but needing only arrowhead brake to clean up the recoil and have a perfectly vertical recoil direction is really hard to pass up. It completely frees up your mod slot for radar tuner, targeting, or whatever else tickles your fancy.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-17"},{"hash":1780464822,"plugs":[[839105230],[1087426260],[2779035018],[3047969693]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-17"},{"hash":1780464822,"plugs":[[839105230],[1561002382,1885400500],[1428297954,744594675,1570042021],[3047969693,124408337,438098033]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-17"},{"hash":1780464822,"plugs":[[839105230],[1561002382],[1428297954],[3047969693]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-17"},{"hash":254636484,"plugs":[[594346985,2713678205],[3721627275,679225683,1087426260],[951095735,3523296417,1556840489,3878366039,1906147653,3442762221],[1546637391,4104185692,11612903,3418165135,3007133316,2422968039]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"To quote the great Sneecher, \"Glaives are kinda like bows to me.

If you play almost any other subclass, the Seventh Seraph CQC-12 is the best in slot.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-17"},{"hash":1478986057,"plugs":[[1300023272],[791862061],[2869569095,2308090567],[2679249093,788178929]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-17"},{"hash":1478986057,"plugs":[[1047830412,1300023272],[3142289711,791862061],[4071163871,509074078,1866048759,494941759,843318450,3118144663],[3511092054,711234314]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-17"},{"hash":1478986057,"plugs":[[1047830412],[3142289711],[4071163871,494941759],[3511092054,711234314]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-17"},{"hash":1532276803,"plugs":[[1840239774,1482024992,4090651448],[3230963543,106909392,1087426260],[247725512,1820235745],[4104185692,2458213969]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really wouldn't take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just don't have the damage or the range you'd want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I'd recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you won't be able to shoot as far, but you're using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload. With such a small mag another great shout is multikill clip to keep damage stacks after each kill.\n\nIn PvP you can go one or two ways max range, or not quite max range. With rangefinder in the third column you can really opt for anything within that final column and be okay. Eye of the storm is a perfect pairing because you'll definitely be taking damage to get into sidearm range to begin with. Multikill clip gives you that slaying potential. If you wanted to invest fully into range you can do so and you'll hit 18.95m, but I'd suggest going to hammer-forged, losing that extra meter and dropping to 17.96 so you won't lose any stats. 18.95 m (max), 17.96 without losing stats","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":1532276803,"plugs":[[1840239774],[3230963543],[247725512],[4104185692]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":1532276803,"plugs":[[3250034553,202670084,1467527085],[3142289711],[2846385770,247725512],[591790007,699525795,2458213969]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":1532276803,"plugs":[[3250034553],[3142289711],[2846385770],[591790007]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":2119346509,"plugs":[[839105230,1482024992,4090651448],[1968497646,1087426260,3230963543],[2010801679,3400784728,1583705720,3797647183,573122728,1409206216],[4293542123,11612903,1048183818,2675184851,2422968039,3431277734]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Ammit AR2 is a fantastic feeling auto rifle, held back by the fact it's an auto rifle.

It's an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you weren't around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it's not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds isn't going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time. But it might just be one of the best arc weapons to use with the new subclasses.\n\nThe crucible weapon is good in the crucible. Who would have thought that? Investing fully into range gives you 21.71 meters of effective range. Funnelweb still beats that out at 23.33 meters, but the Omolon trait of Omolon Fluid Dynamics will give you that extra stability in duels or at longer ranges. It will lose value as you start shooting, but that's where something like dynamic sway reduction or threat detector could come in to make it easier to shoot.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":2988121501,"plugs":[[1482024992],[1885400500],[1820235745],[2610012052]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":2988121501,"plugs":[[3250034553,1482024992,1467527085],[1885400500,1561002382],[2450788523,3523296417,588594999],[2846385770,1015611457,2451262963]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":2988121501,"plugs":[[3250034553],[1885400500],[2450788523],[2846385770]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":4100775158,"plugs":[[839105230,1482024992,1840239774],[3230963543,1968497646,1087426260],[2010801679,1428297954],[2458213969,3523296417,4082225868]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"This is the hotness this season, the Pizzicato-22 or the Pizza Cutter-22 has been making its waves around my circles.

Keep it for collections, but don't actively farm for this weapon.\n\nPvP does not fare much better for the new machine gun. You can bump up the range, stability, and recoil direction and it still kicks like a drunken mule. That also takes away from eye of the storm, damage perks like rampage (not on this gun) or swashbuckler. 900 rpm machine guns need a lot of work just to feel good. Once they feel good, you remember 450s exist and move on to those.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":820890091,"plugs":[[839105230],[106909392],[1428297954,2014892510],[438098033,2748801589]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":820890091,"plugs":[[839105230,1467527085],[3142289711],[1428297954,2450788523,2014892510,4207509907],[699525795,438098033,1890422124,3719974635,2748801589,1523649716]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":820890091,"plugs":[[839105230],[3142289711],[1428297954,2014892510],[699525795,3719974635]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":2671639706,"plugs":[[1840239774,4090651448,1482024992],[3230963543,1087426260,2420895100],[1168162263,2010801679,1428297954],[3425386926,438098033,2458213969]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Pure Poetry is a fantastic addition to the 120 family. With both Crimil's Dagger and Steady Hand being removed from the Iron Banner loot pool there really is only Loud Lullaby in the kinetic slot. Pure Poetry isn't the best option, but it is nice to have it. The best benefit over Loud Lullaby is when you get a few resets in for your vanguard rep and have multiple perks within each column. For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference. Another great option is the newly buffed ambitious assassin to also circumvent the low mag / low reload speed. In the fourth column you can't go wrong with any number of damage perks. Frenzy, rampage, harmony, focused fury, multikill clip, or the new pugilist. Any and all of them are fantastic, but slightly player dependent.\n\nFor PvP I don't see this as a great replacement for Loud Lullaby. Not having kill clip is a big miss on this archetype for the crucible. It can, however, act as a pocket sniper for clean-ups or to prime targets for your team. Fragile focus and opening shot together will give you some insane ranges to blint or clean up targets.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":2671639706,"plugs":[[1840239774],[3230963543],[1168162263],[3425386926]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":2671639706,"plugs":[[1840239774,1482024992],[1561002382,1885400500],[2451262963,1428297954,509074078],[47981717,699525795,3511092054]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":2671639706,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1561002382],[2451262963],[47981717]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-18"},{"hash":1321506184,"plugs":[[839105230,1467527085,3661387068],[106909392,3230963543,1087426260],[3108830275,1583705720,855168139,1409206216],[1771339417,557221067,124408337,3824105627,395388285,2896748467,1171887445,1183436451]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"I get why Bungie had to change Qullim's Terminus from a 450 to a 360, that would make 3 raids that have 450 machine guns.

It has that inflated perk pool like all core playlist weapons. That being said, there's a ton of incredible perks you can choose from. With the recent-ish change of resets adding more perks it will be really easy to get your god roll or at least a usable roll. For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you'd have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you're continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three.\n\nFor PvP it is a decent zoom high-impact frame. You can make a choice between opening shot or snapshot if you crank up the handling high enough. Elemental capacitor will certainly help with that.

Avalanche is just a relic of year 3. It's a weird SUROS machine gun that fires from both barrels. The saving grace is being a 450 RPM machine gun. I went slightly different with my recommendations compared to my peers. With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have. With auto-loading holster you won't have to worry about reload speed and you'll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there's target lock. This season's newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75. With these many bullets you should definitely be the coolest person in your fireteam when you hit the cap on damage and be able to show off that sweet, sweet DEEPS.\n\nAdaptive machine guns have always been my favorite for PvP. Being able to have decent damage at range, good chip damage, and a pretty manageable recoil are all great things to have. Avalanche does bring some good things to the table, like maxing out recoil direction with arrowhead brake. Ricochet rounds gives you some much needed stability. Dynamic sway reduction will reduce your bloom on extended gunfights. On MnK I would recommend swashbuckler or adrenaline junkie for a flat damage bonus. On Controller I would recommend tap the trigger for even more stability.

With the return of the Ikelos SMG this season (and its craftable), Blood Feud last season, the Extraordinary Rendition before that and the Ikelos v2 even further back. The Cold Front just has poor stats across the board. With the lowest stability in its class, the lowest reload and aim assist. Cold Front is tied for the lowest magazine with Blood Feud. Cold Front needs a lot to make it feel and shoot well. In PvE I would recommend corkscrew rifling to give a flat buff to all its stats. Flared magwell offers the best of both reload and stability (two stats this gun desperately needs). Frenzy and Subsistence are my final choices. Frenzy is the best for bringing up even more of Cold Front's poor stats. Subsistence has received multiple buffs and it feels incredible on your primary add clear weapon. It's a good thing no matter what you will look cool shooting this gun.\n\nIt's a similar situation in PvP. Cold Front has a giant hill to climb and with a lot of competition it might not be worth it. Most people have Blood Feud from last season, and the Ikelos SMG just received a pretty nice upgrade. Cold Front does have the best sights IMO so for me it's semi-worth. In PvP you're really looking for consistency or lethality. Cold Front does not have super strong lethality perks like kill clip or multikill clip, so you're looking for consistency. Cold Front does offer rangefinder, putting it on par with its siblings, but the lack of stats still leaves a lot to be desired. Perpetual motion, tap the trigger, smallbore, and stability are all very important stats to look into. With the Ikelos SMG having eighteen more stability at base, you will need all the help you can get.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-19"},{"hash":2814093983,"plugs":[[4090651448],[3230963543],[1820235745],[4104185692]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-19"},{"hash":2814093983,"plugs":[[3250034553],[3142289711],[1428297954],[2846385770]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-19"},{"hash":2814093983,"plugs":[[3250034553],[3142289711],[1428297954],[2846385770]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-19"},{"hash":540880995,"plugs":[[839105230],[106909392,1087426260,3230963543],[1820235745],[2173046394,2610012052,2848615171]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Oh dark decider.

Golden tricorn is fantastic but requires a bit more thinking to maintain 2x.\n\nFor PvP Dark Decider fits into a weird spot. It has some of the lowest base stats within its archetypes but some of the most unique perks that can put it well above the rest. For one, it is the only rapid-fire frame to roll rangefinder. Putting it in a range class well above its stats. It can also roll Iron Grip for a whopping +20 stability without sacrificing your barrel and magazine perks to stability. The only other auto rifle in this class to compete with Dark Decider would be Krait and given comparable rolls (DD - hammer-forged, accurized, iron grip, rangefinder / K - hammer-forged, ricochet, overflow, moving target) Dark Decider would have 2 whole meters over Krait.

A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight and oh gosh my bees are kneed (I know that's not how that goes). There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a \"no thoughts, head empty\" workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun.\n\nTaking that fantastic base and transitioning it over to the crucible is easy. Most of the weapon stays the same. Arrowhead and rapid hit are the foundation. Steady rounds for more stability, or accurized rounds for even more range is your preference. In the last column you have three separate ways you can go. Kill clip is the easiest to use and helps make the second kill easier as you won't need as many critical hits.

Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer's choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there's your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw.\n\nUnfortunately for Prolonged Engagement it won't see a lot of use outside of PvE. Having 14 zoom makes it firmly middle of the pack and having the lowest base range in its class (technically Escape Velocity is lower, but Escape Velocity also gets sights, not barrels) doesn't help it. What it lacks in range it does make up for in stability, being on the upper percentile. It also has some of the best aim assist for its archetype. Rangefinder is definitely a must, as is pushing up the range.

Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo.

Jokes aside, it is really cool to see a new lightweight \"kinetic\" pulse rifle. Its base stats aren't anything to write home about. Tied for stability with Ogma PR6, and Chattering Bone at 52, it also ties the Ogma in range but beats Chattering Bone. Stay Frosty also has the lowest handling, aim assist, and \"magazine\" (it's at 31, Ogma at 32, and Chattering at 33, but they're all three-round pulses. Take that for what you want). It's definitely a little outclassed within the stat department. Where Stay Frosty takes the lead is in its perks. Arrowhead is a must regardless of what activity you're in. Having a base recoil of 55 means you can slap on a CB mod and be at 100. Thresh is an incredible tool for building your supers now that your intellect stat doesn't matter as much compared to whatever tier you're in. Headstone is just fun add clear. Get a crit on a thrall? It's no longer a thrall but a thrallsicle! (I'll see myself out). Short shout-out to Golden tricorn. Golden tricorn is the best for ability cycling and weapon cycling. Being able to have such a huge refreshable buff that stacks with things like elemental wells, high-energy fire, and radiance is too good to pass up. Stasis isn't the strongest on its own for abilities, but it might get a buff. Who knows.\n\nOver in the crucible 450 pulses just aren't anything important. Messenger exists, and the new hotness is Disparity. Stay Frosty has a lot to build up in order to compete. Arrowhead brake is a must, but smallbore is a decent alternative if you're fine with the lower recoil direction. Ricochet rounds brings up the stability and bumps up the range a smidge. Over on MnK I would recommend killing wind for the bump in range, handling and movement speed. Couple that with desperado and you've got a pretty solid roll for going on sprees. On Controller I would recommend something slightly different. Moving target is the only perk I would change. Moving target gives you aim assist and movement speed neutrally. That extra aim assist will help a ton to ensure a crit kill in order to get desperado going in the first place.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-19"},{"hash":2812100428,"plugs":[[839105230],[1968497646],[2726471870],[124408337]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-19"},{"hash":2812100428,"plugs":[[1482024992],[1885400500],[2450788523],[3047969693]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-19"},{"hash":2812100428,"plugs":[[1482024992],[1885400500],[2450788523],[3047969693]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-19"},{"hash":487205709,"plugs":[[839105230],[1087426260,2420895100],[247725512,3523296417,2848615171],[365154968,2173046394,11612903]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Terminus Horizon will be an interesting weapon to use.

Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn't need a raid to acquire. This is the first time since Black Armory that we can find this archetype in the \"wild.\" Insidious and Sacred Provenance are both native to raids. Veles-X is a way to feel out this archetype with a clear path to acquire. It has a pretty good standard roll. Every roll has chambered compensator and flared magwell for better recoil and better reload and stability. Repulsor brace is the only let down for me. If you are a void subclass main, it can be incredible to have a 45 health overshield on demand but having to stay on void lets it down a little bit. Neutrally, tunnel vision is easy to proc and you don't have to think about it at all or set your subclass for it to work. If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you'll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can't get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory.\n\nVeles-X will still have some incredible usefulness in PvP as well. Tunnel vision and kill clip are perfect with one another. At base you have an incredible pulse that can two burst. With kill clip it makes that two burst more forgiving but you also have tunnel vision for more aim assist.

But it also means that the architecture can really mess you up if you go to bounce shot and it splits the grenades into two different directions. I have yet to fully test out the full damage of each grenade, but disruption break will still probably be then play.

Golden Tricorn has become one of my favorite perks to recommend for the sheer damage coupled with our current surge mods.\n\nIn PvP you're really looking for consistency. The adaptive frame pulse rifles can two-burst with any damage bonus. This makes Kill Clip highly sought-after but having a more neutral pulse and surge mods can make this weapon also two-burst. With one surge mod you can two-burst all the way up to 7 resilience. Requiring all headshots. With two surge mods you can two-burst up to 8 resilience. 9 resilience with all three surge mods. Tier 10 will never get two bursted without Kill Clip but it's nice to know if your RNG doesn't favor you.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-20"},{"hash":62937067,"plugs":[[839105230],[1087426260],[1168162263],[4104185692]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-20"},{"hash":62937067,"plugs":[[839105230],[1885400500,1561002382],[11551321,588594999],[1015611457,460017080,591790007]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-20"},{"hash":62937067,"plugs":[[839105230],[1885400500],[11551321],[1015611457]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-20"},{"hash":2972949637,"plugs":[[3525010810,3798852852,1441682018],[3301904089,2985827016],[2869569095,968510818,1523832109,2308090567,424370782,461595545],[3215448563,4104185692,438098033,2888557110,3299896859,3007133316,2748801589,1905598698]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"The raid designs are incredible but I loathe typing out these names.

They just feel so good to use. Omolon Fluid Dynamics aside, these have always been one of my favorite classes of sidearms. Being that Senuna SI6 is stasis, the best perk for it is Headstone. Being able to slow and deal AoE damage off of a single kill is extremely strong. We all know how strong Disorienting Grenades are. Slow is just a different version of that. I don't have to tell you all that. Feeding Frenzy is your best bet if you are \"maining\" this sidearm, but Envious Assassin could be fun. I don't love it on primary ammo weapons as you should be using these the most, but depending on your build you could be swapping more than me. Another great perk to look out for is Golden Tricorn. Less useful if you don't use Stasis, but extremely strong now with our current surge mods.\n\nSenuna SI6 is arguably the best three-burst sidearm. Slickdraw gives you 100 handling. A counterbalance mod gives you 99 recoil direction. You can then invest entirely into range as Omolon Fluid Dynamics will give you your stability. The only issue is the fourth column perk. Headstone is great in 3v3. Elemental Capacitor can bump up your stability on void, or forgo a counterbalance mod on Stasis. If you jump a lot then Strand could be a great option for you. Headseeker is another good option. Ideally I would run Headstone just for locking down that position and having some cover as well. Certainly a gun I will farm for and then throw in my vault to use on random loadout shenanigans.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-20"},{"hash":5159537,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1087426260],[968510818],[124408337]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-20"},{"hash":5159537,"plugs":[[3250034553,1482024992],[1885400500,1561002382],[1821614984,1645158859],[124408337,3511092054,460017080]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-20"},{"hash":5159537,"plugs":[[3250034553],[1885400500],[1821614984],[124408337]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/mnk/season-20"},{"hash":811403305,"plugs":[[1840239774,4090651448,1482024992],[1087426260,3230963543,679225683],[968510818],[1015611457,365154968]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Similar to Round Robin I don't super love Envious Assassin on primaries.

Heck yeah boi. Definitely go for Arrowhead Brake so you have a decent recoil direction. Lightweight scouts don't need much but anything helps.

I'd take more bullets for this one.\n\nPvP (Controller): Moving Target is arguably the best in slot for the third column, and kill clip will allow for some spicy three taps. Definitely keep an eye out for this one. Again Arrowhead Brake is recommended for allowing you to focus less on controlling the recoil and more about crits. Steady Rounds will bump up the stability meaning you have less jump each shot. You shouldn't have to worry about the range drop as scouts have different metrics for range. Handling or stability for masterwork depending on how fast you like your weapons.\n\nPvP (MnK): Similar to the controller recommendation, except it has Accurized Rounds.

Surrounded is the best damage perk for running into a group of enemies, and threat detector just enhances stats. Nothing like immediate damage.\n\nPvP (Controller): This is the best version of the title we have seen. This almost competes with the like of Shayura's Tarrabah, IKELOS and Immortal. No adept mods, not the best range, but having rangefinder is an incredible bonus. Dynamic Sway Reduction is icing on the Title's cake for allowing a smooth shooting experience.\n\nPvP (MnK): The Title doesn't need much to be a powerhouse in this meta. Rangefinder on a 750 is enough. But allowing you to duel multiple enemies within quick succession is another thing entirely. Without offering damage in the way of Kill Clip, the Title does give you Offhand Strike to take on multiple opponents while keeping your strafe speed up.

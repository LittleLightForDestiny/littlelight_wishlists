You can try and make Aisha's Embrace work with perpetual motion and multikill clip, but it won't be as easy to use.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":3245493570,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1087426260],[3400784728],[1546637391]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":3245493570,"plugs":[[1840239774,1482024992,1392496348],[1561002382,1885400500],[1428297954,2946784966],[699525795,3673922083,2458213969]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":3245493570,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1561002382],[1428297954],[699525795]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":372697604,"plugs":[[1840239774,1482024992,4090651448],[106909392,1087426260,2420895100],[247725512,509074078],[1546637391,1954620775,2896038713]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"The Cantata-57 is a Suros hand cannon that feels like a Suros hand cannon. The Finite Impactor while being a Suros hand cannon just doesn't feel as good to me. Cantata-57 feels good, and that's at base. Everything else just builds this gun up to be a beast in PvE content; rivaling even Fatebringer. Ideally you'd want rapid hit and vorpal to cover your majors and minors, but timed payload is a great PvE perk similar to explosive payload. The delay in PvE is negligible and you get nothing but benefits. Rapid hit only works if the bullet portion hits crits but with the aim assist and PvE hit boxes you shouldn't have a horrible time getting rapid hit going.\n\nWhere I've heard the most chatter about the Cantata-57 is from all the PvP players. Having eye of the storm and rangefinder or opening shot is a combo we haven't had since Season of Opulence (rip menagerie, blessed be in our hearts). Eye of the storm and opening shot give you better accuracy for almost your entire gunfight. Whereas rangefinder allows you to comfortably compete with Palindrome. You could also opt for rapid hit to make your consecutive crits easier to hit, or the newly buffed hip-fire grip should you want Under Your Skin levels of spicy. Cantata-57 also completely power crept Annual Skate out of the water by allowing it incredible neutral perks and access to timed payload. Cantata-57 has set itself up to be a really dominant threat to the \"top 3\" hand cannons.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":372697604,"plugs":[[1840239774],[106909392],[247725512],[1546637391]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":372697604,"plugs":[[1840239774,3250034553,1482024992],[3142289711,106909392],[699525795,247725512,1866048759],[2846385770,47981717,1954620775]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":372697604,"plugs":[[1840239774],[3142289711],[699525795],[2846385770]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":999767358,"plugs":[[839105230,1840239774],[689005463,1687452232,1483536627],[1354429876,3436462433,848860060,2658083589],[2213355989,1048183818,2284787283,2002547233,3431277734,3563868667]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Cataclysmic is an interesting linear fusion rifle (does anyone think I say a weapon is \"interesting\" too much?)

Omolon fluid dynamics adds a whopping +20 stability at the top half of the magazine. This puts you right into that 65-75 range of having the best return on your stability and that's just for choosing the omolon trait over the crucible one. Meaning as long as you're diligent in reloading you can keep that buff for every single engagement. You can then invest into range or handling to make the weapon feel perfectly yours.

Where something like the IKELOS_SR_v1.0.2 has great boss dealing capabilities, it is also hard to get. Fugue-55 also released this season has similar boss killing capabilities, but is just as hard to get. Father's Sins is craftable but doesn't offer as much. Focused Fury is great for choosing when to get your damage and being able to reload and triple tap into a bigger mag is a huge boon. But damage phases are moving to more mobile sets, so \"stand and DPS\" is becoming less common. Even still having one in the event a \"stand and DPS\" phase comes back would be nice to keep in your back pocket.\n\nSimilarly Father's Sins is weird in PvP. Lower zoom snipers did just get a small buff to their aim assist cones, and Father's Sins is a 35 zoom sniper. That being said, it doesn't immediately make them good, nor does it make them bad. Most people have shifted towards higher zooms, namely 45 and 50 zooms. The two things that can bump up Father's Sins in my book is the ease of getting one and crafting it to your liking, as well as having access to under pressure and opening shot. With a higher base aim assist than the likes of Occluded Finality and Shephard's Watch it could see some use being the bullet bending sniper.

Higher base zoom than the rest of its archetype, only being surpassed by False Promises. Herod-C does have better base stats almost entirely across the board for the archetype. Where it lacks in some categories it blows out the competition in others. With such a slow rate of fire you won't have to spec as hard into stability to keep the bullets going where you want them to go. Also having the highest stability of its class helps that out too. When it comes to perks Arrowhead will be the play. Bumping fully automatic weapons to 100 recoil direction with a decent amount of handling added will just make your end result an easy shooting experience. Appended mag will help bring up its already high magazine size, but you could opt for armor-piercing rounds for general utility against shields. The trait perks also work in different ways as well. One way you can spec your Herod-C is to create a pseudo-mag through subsistence and demolitionist; or you could breach and clear using subsistence and headstone to rip through groups of enemies; if bosses are your bread and butter having more damage against them and ammo back through fourth time's the charm can also leverage the high damage and magazine Herod-C can provide you.\n\nHigh Impacts have never been high meta within PvP. Taking their slower rate of fire, as well as crit to body damage, and adding in the requirement of having constant line of sight leaves a lot to be desired. But you can make this weapon work for you if you bring up some of its low points. The recoil has to be 100 through Arrowhead Brake to make your life easier. Taking the combination of perpetual motion and tap the trigger also makes shots easier for you. The final bit to add is extra flinch for your enemies via high-caliber rounds.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":1788603939,"plugs":[[839105230],[1087426260],[1820235745],[124408337]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":1788603939,"plugs":[[839105230,1482024992,1392496348],[1561002382,1885400500],[1428297954,1359896290],[1890422124,3523296417,588594999]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":1788603939,"plugs":[[839105230],[1561002382],[1428297954],[1890422124]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":3428521585,"plugs":[[839105230,1840239774],[106909392,1087426260,2420895100],[2848615171,3523296417,247725512,169755979,1906147653,2938480696],[1546637391,1048183818,11612903,3418165135,3431277734,2422968039]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"I'm glad to see more aggressive burst pulse rifles, but I am not glad to see more raid aggressive burst pulse rifles.

Ideally (similar theme here Bungie) you'd want to run arrowhead brake to make your shooting experience just a little bit easier, but Veist weapons usually have good recoil patterns without a good recoil direction so your mileage may vary.

Perpetual motion and either explosive payload or opening shot are the ideal perks to go really incentivise good crucible habits and make your shooting experience better, but if you don't feel like moving around a lot you can opt for rapid hit instead to stay firmly planted at B flag.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":1019000888,"plugs":[[1840239774],[106909392],[247725512],[1546637391]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":1019000888,"plugs":[[1840239774,1482024992,4090651448],[3177308360,106909392],[1428297954,247725512,2946784966],[47981717,3038247973]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":1019000888,"plugs":[[1840239774],[3177308360],[1428297954],[47981717]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-16"},{"hash":2097055732,"plugs":[[839105230,1840239774,1482024992],[1087426260,1561002382,2420895100],[3643424744,1428297954,2682205016,2014892510],[1546637391,2896038713,11612903,3418165135,2402480669,2422968039]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"This is an interesting weapon.

Both with elemental capacitor and quick charge hit 100 handling. Which can further be boosted by steady hands or perpetual motion. Which means you can completely forego handling in favor of more range for deeper clean ups. Range does not increase your one hit kill range, but will make it more consistent in those further ranges when needing slight damage.

One-two punch and frenzy are both incredible options that don't need a lot to feel strong. Demolitionist can help with those grenades.

It's almost a better Chroma Rush for majors while still having good utility in general content. This allows you to expand your loadouts and flex into kinetic (or stasis) special weapons while still having that good bullet hose in your back pocket. You seriously need to clean up the recoil direction so I think arrowhead brake is a must-have on any Sweet Sorrow you do end up keeping. A recoil direction stat of 57 is just far too low. Ideally the +45 from arrowhead brake and a counterbalance mod would be the best choice but I know that minor spec or backup mag would be the better choice for most users. Triple tap and vorpal weapon together can help you shred some majors or champions, but the overall lower base damage leans me to recommending other weapons specifically for major killing. You can make it work but it's not ideal.\n\nThis is a fun situation where PvE and PvP mix. Arrowhead brake is still the best barrel, and I would recommend a counterbalance mod to get that recoil to 100 and give you the ease of use to invest into range or more consistency perks. The \"big\" damage perks on Sweet Sorrow don't lend themselves to the PvP landscape, but one could argue demolitionist is a lethality perk, especially with current Void 3.0 grenades. Truthfully I'd try and make this weapon as consistent as physically possible and spec fully into stability.

Wait. That's not entirely true. The Gambit focus weapon this season is called Dead Weight. Rapid-fire shotguns have always been my favorite for one-two punch builds. One-two punch doesn't really rely on the damage from the shotgun as your melee is then increased by 200% (80% with Liar's Handshake). So you don't really have to invest as heavily into any one stat. Range is negligible as you will be barrel stuffing a boss to be within melee range. Stability doesn't really matter on shotguns in general. Handling does help to make follow up shots a little faster. And with grave robber you can completely ignore the reload stat. Any mag boosting perk brings you right to the magazine cap of 8. So really any other perks just benefit the shotgun to make it feel better. If you dislike one-two punch (how dare you) there's plenty of other alternative combinations like swashbuckler and subsistence for keeping the damage going, or subsistence and adrenaline junkie for grenade focused builds. If you prefer a more pocket shotgun feel then auto-loading holster is the best in slot.\n\nRapid-fire shotguns do not fare so well in PvP compared to PvE. Full choke is still mandatory to secure the best possibility for a two-tap kill. Accurized rounds pushes out the fall off so you'd still be able to do that solid 1 damage at 3m and beyond. Perpetual motion brings up the already healthy handling. Where Dead Weight falls off hard is in the final column. Not having access to some of the top tier perks like opening shot or even elemental capacitor to max out the range adds to the downfall of this shotgun.

I think swashbuckler is the best option for the last column as melee kills in cqc are common and going into the next fight with a large damage boost will make your sidearm hit like a hand cannon.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":502356570,"plugs":[[1840239774],[106909392],[744594675,2139363611],[3425386926,288411554]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":502356570,"plugs":[[3250034553,1482024992,1467527085],[3142289711],[588594999,699525795,2717805783,3719974635],[4082225868,3425386926,1161469972,288411554]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":502356570,"plugs":[[3250034553],[3142289711],[588594999,2717805783],[4082225868,1161469972]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":1601177201,"plugs":[[1840239774,1482024992,4090651448],[106909392,1087426260,2420895100],[2779035018,2946784966],[3708227201,2458213969,3425386926]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Precision frame smgs struggle in PvE content. Both of the 900 rpm smgs just pump out damage faster, and aggressive frames hit like a truck while still maintaining a lot of that spray. Precision frames have the best base range for all smgs but comically low handling, reload, and stability. All three of which are important in PvE activities. Reload especially. Enyo-D comes equipped with feeding frenzy to circumvent the low reload, and fluted barrel will bump up that low handling. I like surrounded with surrounded spec for the best damage, but multikill clip coupled with feeding frenzy is a great option too.\n\nWhere I've heard the most chatter around Enyo-D is in the Crucible. People are calling it the Antiope-D 2.0 or the kinetic Shayura's Wrath. I think both are true, but the Enyo-D still has some shortcomings when it comes to comparing against the both. Enyo-D does not have kill clip. Multikill clip is fine and good, but the immediate 33% damage bonus is incredible on any precision frame smg. Enyo-D also has less zoom than both. The zoom field has been condensed, but the 16 zoom smgs will still be some of the best out of the gate. Steady hands also brings up one of Enyo-D's weakest stats and makes it feel incredibly fluid.

I originally thought I would love it back in opulence, but the nature and rpm of the high-impact frame machine guns makes them feel so slow. To make Fixed Odds feel a little less slow, run either arrowhead brake for the recoil direction or fluted barrel to bring up one of its worst stats. Any mag boosting perk is preferred in the second column. Feeding frenzy or field prep will depend on how you play, but both bring up another low stat. Finally depending on how you play, killing tally, firing line, or incandescent are all fantastic perks. If you're using a Solar 3.0 subclass, incandescent and feeding frenzy make a great pairing. If you prefer any other subclass and are solo, killing tally will be phenomenal. Finally if you run group activities a lot, firing line and field prep will be excellent for boss or major dps.\n\nHigh-Impact machine guns in PvP are not the first choice, and really not even the second or third choice either. Their TtK is competitive, but their forgiveness and ease of use is not. Arrowhead brake really cleans up the recoil and will make follow up shots a lot easier to hit. Pair that with accurized rounds to extend your engagement range. Finally, because of the nature of heavy ammo in PvP, you'll be happy to grab a roll with under pressure for the added accuracy and stability.

Polymer string and a draw time masterwork is all that's needed to reach the draw time floor without sacrificing any accuracy. Lunulata-4b's low accuracy stat of 25 means losing some would nearly drop you to the floor. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy stat up to a respectable amount, but nowhere near perfect. The clear best perk is headstone, but having adrenaline junkie on a bow is fun. If you didn't get one on a Fel Taradiddle then Lunulata-4b is your next best option. (though you could always craft a Fel Taradiddle).\n\nUnfortunately my enthusiasm doesn't extend to PvP. Which is fine, not all PvE weapons have to be strong in PvP and vice versa. Lightweight bows just don't feel as strong as their precision brethren. To make the most of Lunulata-4b you'll want to drop the draw time down to the floor. Rangefinder doesn't do a ton to make the arrows more hit-scan or extend your range by a ton, but it does make those longer shots feel a bit more sticky and successful warm-up will make follow up kills easier to manage.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":2513965917,"plugs":[[852209214],[3429800428],[744594675],[124408337]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":2513965917,"plugs":[[852209214,1784898267],[3429800428,3827198035,3311977193],[2846385770,2866798147,509074078],[2652708987,11612903,124408337]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":2513965917,"plugs":[[852209214],[3429800428],[2846385770],[2652708987]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":1780464822,"plugs":[[839105230],[1087426260,1968497646,2420895100],[2779035018,1428297954],[3047969693,1546637391,124408337]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"It's like Messenger but more angular.

You probably won't see golden tricorn 2x too often, but when you do and the stars align you'll have a monster in your hands.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":3000847393,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1087426260],[2779035018],[4104185692]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":3000847393,"plugs":[[3661387068,1467527085,1482024992],[1885400500,1561002382],[3523296417,509074078,744594675],[11612903,2610012052]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":3000847393,"plugs":[[3661387068],[1885400500],[3523296417],[11612903]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":1478986057,"plugs":[[1300023272,1482024992,4090651448],[791862061,106909392,1087426260],[2869569095,744594675,2308090567,2139363611],[2679249093,1546637391,4293542123,788178929,3418165135,2675184851]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Without Remorse is an interesting shotgun. It competes with everyone's favorite Seventh Seraph CQC-12. Without Remorse has better range and stability, but worse handling and reload. They are very comparable though, only being a maximum of 9 points off in stability. Where Without Remorse wins is in the PvE category. One-Two Punch is my favorite damage perk regardless of what subclass you play on. Having a 200% damage increase to your non-ranged melee is incredibly fun for destroying majors or chunky red bars. Pair that with auto-loading holster to keep your mag topped off is the way to go.\n\nWhere things get a lot closer is in the crucible. A very common perk combo to run in order to max out handling is via threat detector and elemental capacitor on arc. The Seventh Seraph CQC-12 has a different but equally effective max handling combination in snapshot and quickdraw. Depending on how you play I think the winner will be decided that way. If you enjoy arc subclasses, Without Remorse is the reigning champion. If you play almost any other subclass, the Seventh Seraph CQC-12 is the best in slot.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":1478986057,"plugs":[[1300023272],[791862061],[2869569095,2308090567],[2679249093,788178929]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":1478986057,"plugs":[[1047830412,1300023272],[3142289711,791862061],[4071163871,509074078,1866048759,494941759,843318450,3118144663],[3511092054,711234314]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":1478986057,"plugs":[[1047830412],[3142289711],[4071163871,494941759],[3511092054,711234314]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-17"},{"hash":1532276803,"plugs":[[1840239774,1482024992,4090651448],[3230963543,106909392,1087426260],[247725512,1820235745],[4104185692,2458213969]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really wouldn't take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just don't have the damage or the range you'd want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I'd recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you won't be able to shoot as far, but you're using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload. With such a small mag another great shout is multikill clip to keep damage stacks after each kill.\n\nIn PvP you can go one or two ways max range, or not quite max range. With rangefinder in the third column you can really opt for anything within that final column and be okay. Eye of the storm is a perfect pairing because you'll definitely be taking damage to get into sidearm range to begin with. Multikill clip gives you that slaying potential. If you wanted to invest fully into range you can do so and you'll hit 18.95m, but I'd suggest going to hammer-forged, losing that extra meter and dropping to 17.96 so you won't lose any stats. 18.95 m (max), 17.96 without losing stats","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-18"},{"hash":1532276803,"plugs":[[1840239774],[3230963543],[247725512],[4104185692]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-18"},{"hash":1532276803,"plugs":[[1840239774,3250034553,1482024992],[3142289711,3230963543],[2846385770,247725512],[699525795,2458213969,591790007]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-18"},{"hash":1532276803,"plugs":[[1840239774],[3142289711],[2846385770],[699525795]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-18"},{"hash":2119346509,"plugs":[[839105230,1482024992,4090651448],[1968497646,1087426260,3230963543],[2010801679,3400784728,1583705720,3797647183,573122728,1409206216],[4293542123,11612903,1048183818,2675184851,2422968039,3431277734]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Ammit AR2 is a fantastic feeling auto rifle, held back by the fact it's an auto rifle.

It's an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you weren't around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it's not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds isn't going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time. But it might just be one of the best arc weapons to use with the new subclasses.\n\nThe crucible weapon is good in the crucible. Who would have thought that?

With both Crimil's Dagger and Steady Hand being removed from the Iron Banner loot pool there really is only Loud Lullaby in the kinetic slot. Pure Poetry isn't the best option, but it is nice to have it. The best benefit over Loud Lullaby is when you get a few resets in for your vanguard rep and have multiple perks within each column. For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference. Another great option is the newly buffed ambitious assassin to also circumvent the low mag / low reload speed. In the fourth column you can't go wrong with any number of damage perks. Frenzy, rampage, harmony, focused fury, multikill clip, or the new pugilist. Any and all of them are fantastic, but slightly player dependent.\n\nFor PvP I don't see this as a great replacement for Loud Lullaby. Not having kill clip is a big miss on this archetype for the crucible. It can, however, act as a pocket sniper for clean-ups or to prime targets for your team.

Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you'd have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you're continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three.\n\nFor PvP it is a decent zoom high-impact frame. You can make a choice between opening shot or snapshot if you crank up the handling high enough. Elemental capacitor will certainly help with that. Perpetual motion and moving target are also both incredible perks on snipers, one boosting low stats, the other adding forgiveness through aim assist.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":676270382,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1087426260],[3400784728,573122728],[1771339417,395388285]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":676270382,"plugs":[[1840239774,4090651448],[3142289711],[588594999,3511092054,1428297954,2717805783,711234314,2014892510],[957782887,47981717,4116820839,1370847713]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":676270382,"plugs":[[1840239774],[3142289711],[588594999,2717805783],[957782887,4116820839]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":963710795,"plugs":[[839105230],[689005463,2680121939,1483536627],[1523832109,1820235745],[2978966579,2610012052,3523296417]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Oh this is a spicy roll.

Avalanche is just a relic of year 3. It's a weird SUROS machine gun that fires from both barrels. The saving grace is being a 450 RPM machine gun. I went slightly different with my recommendations compared to my peers. With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have. With auto-loading holster you won't have to worry about reload speed and you'll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there's target lock. This season's newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75. With these many bullets you should definitely be the coolest person in your fireteam when you hit the cap on damage and be able to show off that sweet, sweet DEEPS.\n\nAdaptive machine guns have always been my favorite for PvP. Being able to have decent damage at range, good chip damage, and a pretty manageable recoil are all great things to have. Avalanche does bring some good things to the table, like maxing out recoil direction with arrowhead brake. Ricochet rounds gives you some much needed stability. Dynamic sway reduction will reduce your bloom on extended gunfights. On MnK I would recommend swashbuckler or adrenaline junkie for a flat damage bonus. On Controller I would recommend tap the trigger for even more stability. Not all of it is needed, but having a gun you don't have to fight will make your job easier and you can focus on your opponent.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":495940989,"plugs":[[839105230],[1087426260],[3300816228,3528046508],[365154968,2939589096]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":495940989,"plugs":[[839105230],[1885400500],[1359896290,3060983774],[1890422124,1523649716]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":495940989,"plugs":[[839105230],[1885400500],[1359896290,3060983774],[1890422124,1523649716]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":1903182562,"plugs":[[3525010810,1441682018,3798852852],[3796465595,2985827016],[2869569095,3523296417,2010801679,2308090567,1906147653,3797647183],[4104185692,3927722942,2396489472,3007133316,1167468626,598607952]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Blowout will be an alright addition to your arsenal.

With the return of the Ikelos SMG this season (and its craftable), Blood Feud last season, the Extraordinary Rendition before that and the Ikelos v2 even further back. The Cold Front just has poor stats across the board. With the lowest stability in its class, the lowest reload and aim assist. Cold Front is tied for the lowest magazine with Blood Feud. Cold Front needs a lot to make it feel and shoot well. In PvE I would recommend corkscrew rifling to give a flat buff to all its stats. Flared magwell offers the best of both reload and stability (two stats this gun desperately needs). Frenzy and Subsistence are my final choices. Frenzy is the best for bringing up even more of Cold Front's poor stats. Subsistence has received multiple buffs and it feels incredible on your primary add clear weapon. It's a good thing no matter what you will look cool shooting this gun.\n\nIt's a similar situation in PvP. Cold Front has a giant hill to climb and with a lot of competition it might not be worth it. Most people have Blood Feud from last season, and the Ikelos SMG just received a pretty nice upgrade. Cold Front does have the best sights IMO so for me it's semi-worth. In PvP you're really looking for consistency or lethality. Cold Front does not have super strong lethality perks like kill clip or multikill clip, so you're looking for consistency. Cold Front does offer rangefinder, putting it on par with its siblings, but the lack of stats still leaves a lot to be desired. Perpetual motion, tap the trigger, smallbore, and stability are all very important stats to look into. With the Ikelos SMG having eighteen more stability at base, you will need all the help you can get.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":2814093983,"plugs":[[4090651448],[3230963543],[1820235745],[4104185692]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":2814093983,"plugs":[[1482024992],[3142289711],[1890422124],[2846385770]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":2814093983,"plugs":[[1482024992],[3142289711],[1890422124],[2846385770]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":540880995,"plugs":[[839105230],[106909392,1087426260,3230963543],[1820235745],[2173046394,2610012052,2848615171]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Oh dark decider.

Putting it in a range class well above its stats. It can also roll Iron Grip for a whopping +20 stability without sacrificing your barrel and magazine perks to stability. The only other auto rifle in this class to compete with Dark Decider would be Krait and given comparable rolls (DD - hammer-forged, accurized, iron grip, rangefinder / K - hammer-forged, ricochet, overflow, moving target) Dark Decider would have 2 whole meters over Krait.

A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight and oh gosh my bees are kneed (I know that's not how that goes).

Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a \"no thoughts, head empty\" workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun.\n\nTaking that fantastic base and transitioning it over to the crucible is easy.

Arrowhead brake is the best thing for these dawning weapons. Maxing out recoil direction will just make the shooting experience easier. Not having to think about recoil control just means you can focus on how cool this gun is. Subsistence will continue to keep reservoir burst up, but newer fusions can roll reservoir burst and keep it for more than one shot. Glacioclasm is a product of power creep, but that's okay. Not needing to think about how many shots of reservoir burst you have left and instead going 1:1 makes things easier. Easy is good. I will also give a special shoutout to Golden tricorn. SImilar to Stay Frosty, having the ability cycling and one of the highest damage outputs you can imagine for this weapon type is incredible. Void also gives you more ways of uptime and refresh-ability. Definitely keep an eye out for that.\n\nIn PvP it's all about stacking as many consistency perks as possible. Lowering the charge time via accelerated coils and charge time MW so you won't have to pre-charge as long. Arrowhead to make tracking easier. Under pressure for the most accuracy bonuses.

Having a base recoil of 55 means you can slap on a CB mod and be at 100. Thresh is an incredible tool for building your supers now that your intellect stat doesn't matter as much compared to whatever tier you're in. Headstone is just fun add clear. Get a crit on a thrall?

Stasis isn't the strongest on its own for abilities, but it might get a buff. Who knows.\n\nOver in the crucible 450 pulses just aren't anything important. Messenger exists, and the new hotness is Disparity. Stay Frosty has a lot to build up in order to compete. Arrowhead brake is a must, but smallbore is a decent alternative if you're fine with the lower recoil direction. Ricochet rounds brings up the stability and bumps up the range a smidge. Over on MnK I would recommend killing wind for the bump in range, handling and movement speed. Couple that with desperado and you've got a pretty solid roll for going on sprees. On Controller I would recommend something slightly different. Moving target is the only perk I would change. Moving target gives you aim assist and movement speed neutrally.

Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn't need a raid to acquire. This is the first time since Black Armory that we can find this archetype in the \"wild.\" Insidious and Sacred Provenance are both native to raids. Veles-X is a way to feel out this archetype with a clear path to acquire. It has a pretty good standard roll. Every roll has chambered compensator and flared magwell for better recoil and better reload and stability. Repulsor brace is the only let down for me. If you are a void subclass main, it can be incredible to have a 45 health overshield on demand but having to stay on void lets it down a little bit. Neutrally, tunnel vision is easy to proc and you don't have to think about it at all or set your subclass for it to work. If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you'll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can't get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory.\n\nVeles-X will still have some incredible usefulness in PvP as well. Tunnel vision and kill clip are perfect with one another. At base you have an incredible pulse that can two burst. With kill clip it makes that two burst more forgiving but you also have tunnel vision for more aim assist. With the recent change to kill clip and tunnel vision, both can be refreshed so it keeps both perks active whenever you get a kill.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":2276328320,"plugs":[[3661387068],[3230963543],[776531651],[2610012052]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":2276328320,"plugs":[[3661387068],[3230963543],[2946784966],[1015611457]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":2276328320,"plugs":[[3661387068],[3230963543],[2946784966],[1015611457]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-19"},{"hash":3183283212,"plugs":[[3525010810,1441682018,3798852852],[3032599245,3301904089],[2396489472,3300816228,2869569095],[4104185692,2610012052,3194351027]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Wendigo is back!

Still less than the base of 67 but the added benefits of an increasing stability in a gunfight can give you the edge.","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-20"},{"hash":3166250992,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1087426260],[247725512],[4104185692]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-20"},{"hash":3166250992,"plugs":[[1840239774,3250034553,1482024992],[1885400500,1561002382],[2846385770,247725512],[591790007,699525795]],"tags":["PVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-20"},{"hash":3166250992,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1885400500],[2846385770],[591790007]],"tags":["GodPVP"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-20"},{"hash":2653171213,"plugs":[[1300023272,4090651448,1482024992],[791862061,1087426260,106909392],[691659142,3436462433,3161816588],[2679249093,1546637391,4082225868]],"tags":["PVE"],"description":"Astral Horizon graces yet again.

I don't have to tell you all that. Feeding Frenzy is your best bet if you are \"maining\" this sidearm, but Envious Assassin could be fun.

A counterbalance mod gives you 99 recoil direction. You can then invest entirely into range as Omolon Fluid Dynamics will give you your stability. The only issue is the fourth column perk. Headstone is great in 3v3. Elemental Capacitor can bump up your stability on void, or forgo a counterbalance mod on Stasis. If you jump a lot then Strand could be a great option for you. Headseeker is another good option. Ideally I would run Headstone just for locking down that position and having some cover as well.

I got excited by this shotgun for one mere fact. Slickdraw. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it has been mine for the past season. I have been slowly collecting Slickdraw weapons and changing crafted weapons to utilize Slickdraw. Now I know Slickdraw reduces your auto-aim cone size; it just means you have to be a bit more accurate when aiming. You can achieve a similar effect of Slickdraw by going with Arc Elemental Capacitor, Barrel Shroud, a Handling MW, and Quick Access Sling for 96 handling. This gives you a ready speed of 0.20s and an aim down sights speed of 0.23s. However just having Slickdraw drops you to the same ready speed and drops a hundredth of a second off of aim down sights. This means you can invest every other stat point into range.

I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map.\n\nThat specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more \"on demand\" perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter.\n\nLet's briefly talk about the curated roll.

I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map.\n\nThat specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more \"on demand\" perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter.\n\nLet's briefly talk about the curated roll.

Unfortunately being a world drop means we won't even be able to farm these until next season's lost sectors and even then that's not a given.\nMasterworks: Reload Speed","originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-24"},{"hash":3959549446,"plugs":[[1840239774],[1087426260],[3418782618,1563455254],[3708227201,781192741]],"tags":["GodPVE"],"originalWishlist":"pandapaxxy/controller/season-24"},{"hash":3959549446,"plugs":[[3250034553,1482024992],[1885400500,1561002382],[1359896290,880644845,3060983774,3120212825],[2387244414,124408337,1748774930,1171887445]],"tags":["PVP"],"description":"Yarovit MG4 has the makings to become the best Stasis smg in the game.

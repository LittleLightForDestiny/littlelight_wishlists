Lone Wolf and Box Breathing work together to increase aim assist and crit multiplier, leading to a devastating first shot in an engagement. Of course, the classics of Kill Clip and Explosive Payload are also present, so you do have options. As most maps won't require a full investment in Range, the focus should be on Stability for your Masterwork, Barrel, and Magazine.\nMasterworks: Range, Stability"

Crossing Over as the origin trait, paired with 4 different non-kill-requiring perks (Keep Away or Zen Moment + Tap the Trigger or Target Lock) means this brings a lot of potency without any real requirements.

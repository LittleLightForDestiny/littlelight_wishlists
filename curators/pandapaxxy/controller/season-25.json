But outside of that roll you've got great neutral perks like Eye of the Storm, Headseeker, Zen Moment, and Keep Away. Kill Clip will always just work and doesn't need too much thought to keep going. Bygones still remains a top choice but it's a tad less forgiving now.\nMasterworks: Stability"

Depending on your environment and play style both are extremely strong. Explosive Payload still works for dealing extra flinch and Headstone is exceptional at denying revives in Trials.\n\n[WarlockMaggie MnK PvP] While a direct competitor with the Solstice-sourced Something New, Exuviae unfortunately lacks the top shelf perks like the latter for PvP. The best options are Keep Away and Lone Wolf as they both provide some stat increases but require keeping your enemies and friends away respectively. Precision Instrument continues to be a solid option whereas Explosive Payload is good for throwing off enemy player aim. Fix the Handling to your preference and then focus on Range.\nMasterworks: Range, Stability"

Kill Clip bakes in even more forgiveness if you secure a kill first and Desperado can make your two burst even faster than the High-Impact Frame pulses which is neat.

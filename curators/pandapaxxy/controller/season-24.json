Any weapon kill then swapping to Ded Gramarye IV will give you 8 seconds of infinite shots that explode enemies. What more could you ask for? Voltshot is another great perk as shotguns naturally load one bullet at a time so you can shoot once, reload that once and your next shot will apply all that Jolting goodness. This can be done indefinitely as long as you have ammo. I think on Arc and even neutral builds this might become one of the top picks, the issue is getting one to drop.\nMasterworks: Reload Speed"

These weapons lack the peek shooting capabilities and don't out range the other archetypes falling somewhere between the two. You'll want to boost the weapons stats via Rapid Hit, Perpetual Motion or even Enlightened Action. Unrelenting stays up for a longer time than most players expect and can act as a pseudo Heal Clip when you chain kills. The easiest way to do that is with Golden Tricorn or Swashbuckler depending on the build you're going for. Void builds should use Golden Tricorn to get to 2x allowing for a blistering 3c1b TtK at 0.57s. If you're not going void but invest in strength or a melee build, Swashbuckler 5x allows for the same TtK but at 4c at all resilience levels. Golden Tricorn adds forgiveness but has the tradeoff of being slightly harder to pull off\nMasterworks: Range, Stability"

Speleologist has Envious Assassin for overflowing the magazine based on kills, and Killing Tally to really ramp up the damage, but it will never overthrow the king of machine gun DPS, Retrofit Escapade. Incandescent will clear rooms easier and your choice of Stats for All or Enlightened Action will increase the weapon feel. The Musketeer build of Stats and One for All is fun and synergizes well but on a heavy weapon I find it lacking.\nMasterworks: Reload Speed"

One stack of Killing Tally adds forgiveness but if you manage to get 2 kills you'll drop T4 resilience guardians in a blistering 0.33s (3 stacks of Killing Tally bring the resilience gate to T9). Incandescent would probably be my pick as you're not trying to guess what resilience level your enemies are at and allows for some splash damage also making the second kill easier.

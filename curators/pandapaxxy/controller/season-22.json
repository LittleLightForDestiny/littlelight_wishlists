            "description": "Abyss Defiant is a high-impact auto rifle with arguably better perks than Ammit. Ammit doesn't have reliable reload perks but can definitely maintain great damage. Keeping all that damage, bumping it up a tad but slowing down the fire rate is Abyss Defiant's main claim to fame (that was a mouthful). Reconstruction and Subsistence with your flavor of damage perk will give you a reliable auto rifle to completely destroy whatever is standing in your way. The combination of Heal Clip and Kill Clip is nice to see.\n\nHigh-impact autos in PvP are not strong. Can you slay out with them? For sure. Are they meta? Definitely not. Kill Clip is the strongest perk you can use on Abyss Defiant, and your choice of accuracy booster will keep your bullets true. Reconstruction is here for anyone who dislikes reloading. Eye of the Storm will help in pure 1v1 fights but will fall off in any 1v2+ fights. Swashbuckler could be fun with any of the melee heavy builds to get an incredibly fast 0.67s TtK with 4 crits and 1 body. (psst, with Radiant it becomes a 4 crit kill at 0.50s TtK, just FYI).\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload PvP: Stability"

            "description": "Brya's Love is probably the only weapon I will really grind out, and this is only for PvE. Brya's Love has some incredible perk combinations I would love to try out. Destabilizing Rounds on void has some incredible utility. Precision Instrument will probably take the cake as the next Vorpal Weapon being able to scale up damage with ease. Pair that with Rapid Hit to really get the most for your precision hits. Another great perk to craft would be Shoot to Loot to get your ammo and orbs from a distance. Not being required to chase after orbs is a pretty big benefit.\n\nIn PvP Brya's could see some niche usage like a Box Breathing Hung Jury. I don't think it will be enough to break the meta but it will be a unique pick on longer ranged maps. I don't find myself swapping weapons depending on the map, but it would be a safe pick on Widow's Court or Eternity.\nMasterworks: PvE: Handling,Reload Speed PvP: Stability"

With Envious Assassin and Bait and Switch you can really get some incredible damage out. Even reloader perks like Auto-Loading Holster and Field Prep are incredible too, it just depends on the damage cycle. Explosive Light and Chain Reaction are both tried and true combinations.\n\nIn PvP there isn't much to talk about. Grenade launchers are the best in slot, Proximity Grenades allow you some forgiveness and Impulse Amplifier gives you a pocket rocket. Your best option for multikills is with Chain Reaction.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Velocity"

            "description": "Deadpan Delivery is a great shotgun for most players looking for a \"plug and play\" shotgun. Being able to have Overflow and One-Two Punch for the highest damage show followed by the most One-Two Punch...punches. The only other synergy you could have asked for is Grave Robber for instant refresh on melee kills. However, on bigger bosses that might need a few more hits than your magazine allows this could slot in perfectly. Being Arc it also has some synergy with the Hunter class and can play into blinding / amplified builds. Discord is another interesting shout as you can run around with Frenzy for full uptime on damage and always having ammo to shoot with. Barrel Constrictor is an interesting perk for PvE as it makes sure all your pellets hit but it would be better paired with One-Two Punch instead of in the same column.\n\nI'm not going to lie. I got excited by this shotgun for one mere fact. Slickdraw. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it has been mine for the past season. I have been slowly collecting Slickdraw weapons and changing crafted weapons to utilize Slickdraw. Now I know Slickdraw reduces your auto-aim cone size; it just means you have to be a bit more accurate when aiming. You can achieve a similar effect of Slickdraw by going with Arc Elemental Capacitor, Barrel Shroud, a Handling MW, and Quick Access Sling for 96 handling. This gives you a ready speed of 0.20s and an aim down sights speed of 0.23s. However just having Slickdraw drops you to the same ready speed and drops a hundredth of a second off of aim down sights. This means you can invest every other stat point into range. Bungie knew what they were doing when bringing in this weapon as Deadpan Delivery has the second lowest range stat of all Aggressive Frame shotguns even losing to the Uncommon Ded Nemoris II.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Handling"

Whether that's Retrofit Escapade, Planck's Stride, Recurrent Impact, Shattered Cipher, or reaching all the way back even a Thermal Erosion. That being said, the only direct competition Eleatic Principle has is with Planck's Stride, which I think Eleatic Principle blows Planck's out of the water. Eleatic has access to Golden Tricorn which is the best damage perk in the game, or if you prefer not to use an arc subclass you could go with Target Lock for a slightly different Retrofit. You won't have access to a reload or mag extending perk but you can make the shots easier to land with Zen Moment, Well Rounded, or after some kills even Heating Up.\n\nEleatic Principle will live and die by the PvE metascene, so there isn't much hope for it in PvP. Moving Target or Zen Moment paired with Tap the Trigger will allow you to stay on target a bit with the 900 RPM, and if you're a good shot you could take advantage of Target Lock for a slight edge.\nMasterworks: PvE: Stability PvP: Stability"

Being able to scorch rooms with Incandescent and get some healing back like Unrelenting makes this a sidearm version of the CALUS-Mini Tool.\n\nI don't think the Heliocentric QSc will have as much fun in PvP. Kill Clip is the only solid fourth column perk, and while Rangefinder did get nerfed it will be strong on this sidearm for pushing out the AA, thus extending its feel. You'll still want to push out the range via Hammer-Forged Rifling, Accurized Rounds and a Range MW.\nMasterworks: PvE: Range PvP: Range"

Keep Away with Eye of the Storm is going to be the best perk combo to look for. Fragile Focus is nice but requires you to not get hit. Rapid Hit is a great shout but you have to hit your crits in order to gain the benefits. Miss a shot and it's almost like starting from zero.

            "description": "Probably the most hyped weapon from this season. Rightfully so the Igneous Hammer is an incredible weapon. Rapid Hit and Incandescent for clearing rooms, or Golden Tricorn with solar builds to have the highest damage possible.\n\nIgneous Hammer is a real do-it-all but the crucible is where the Hammer can flex its wings. Keep Away with Eye of the Storm is going to be the best perk combo to look for. Fragile Focus is nice but requires you to not get hit. Rapid Hit is a great shout but you have to hit your crits in order to gain the benefits. Miss a shot and it's almost like starting from zero. If you want something that doesn't require you to get hit you can opt for Moving Target or Opening Shot to pair with Keep Away\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Stability"

Fatebringer, Austringer, Eyasluna, Spare Rations, and to a lesser extent D.F.A. and Dire Promise. What does Kept Confidence bring to the table? Well, in PvE not a whole lot. If you're constantly cycling debuffs it could be interesting, but not all subclasses have equal access to debuffs. Void warlock and hunter could be the strongest uptime with child and the smoke bomb applying debuffs. Otherwise I think this perk is mostly useless. It then leaves us with a dilemma; what is the best PvE perk on Kept Confidence for PvE? Stats for All is probably going to be your best bet. It leaves a lot to be desired, but is the best we can do. Pairing this with Collective Action or Multikill Clip are going to be your best bets. There aren't a lot of good combinations for PvE with this hand cannon.\n\nPvP is another story. There's really only one or two ways this hand cannon can work. You can either opt for a \"win more\" perk like Killing Wind or a more neutral perk like Quickdraw depending on how you play. Neither are exceptionally better than the other, but the main pairing for both is Eye of the Storm. Kept Confidence could have been released as a static weapon like Epochal Integration and people would still use the same perks. Your barrel and masterwork choice is really up to preference if you want more stability, handling, or range.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Range,Stability"

You can get some great usage in PvE with Overflow and Firing Line for some great damage but we already have a better version in Thoughtless. Thoughtless beats out every stat of Locus Locutus except for the airborne effectiveness stat. Locus Locutus has +2 at 4. So the only stat Locus Locutus beats Thoughtless in is a waste stat. Both can roll Overflow and Firing Line. Both can also get Headstone. Kill Clip is unique to Locus Locutus but you have to ask yourself if Kill Clip is worth it in PvE.\n\nIn PvP Thoughtless is hands down better. Thoughtless can roll Snapshot or Headstone. Perpetual Motion for a better handling bonus. The only reason you want to use Locus Locutus over Thoughtless is due to Opening Shot being stacked on Keep Away. This way you can stack fully into handling as enhanced Opening Shot and Keep Away with Accurized Rounds puts you at a flat 100 range. While not the most optimal in most Guardian's eyes, it will still be a solid weapon to use.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Handling"

            "description": "Luna Regolith III is the new vanguard sniper. Triple Tap and Clown Cartridge are the best in slot, but Field Prep will be great for longer damage phases. Firing Line is going to be your best damage buff, but Higher Ground will be good for solo players. It's not the most reliable as you can't always be higher than your target. But when it works, an extra 20% is an extra 20%.\n\nIn PvP there are really only a few options. Max handling with Snapshot Sights and Opening Shot will be the most sought after roll. But I wouldn't be opposed to Eye of the Storm, Moving Target, or even one of my favorite silly perk combos: Opening Shot and Under Pressure. Previously this was only on the Occluded Finality with its monstrous zoom. That also helped in bullet bending, but as the majority of players prefer short zooms this will allow other players to enjoy my silly combo.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Handling"

Enlightened Action is the best perk for 120s, it bumps up two of the lower stats of the archetypes; handling and reload. Explosive payload also bumps up the damage ever so slightly. Harmony and Discord work really well together to constantly have a full magazine and a damage bump for 7 seconds. You won't be able to keep up the damage bump, but the synergy is there.\n\nIn PvP the handling and gun feel continue here too. But you're only really going to use Explosive Payload and Enlightened Action. The stability bump from Flared Magwell, Fluted Barrel, and the stability MW make round out all the stats you need.\nMasterworks: PvE: Stability PvP: Stability"

            "description": "Nightshade returns in its third, and hopefully, final glory. With a recoil direction of 56 you almost need Arrowhead Brake in order to fire at full RPM. In PvE I would highly recommend Flared Magwell or Light Mag depending on if you want range or stability. The added reload will feel incredible. You can then stack on Outlaw or Enlightened Action for better reload on top of that, or even Keep Away to bump out your range and handling. I find that in certain activities it is hard to keep enemies away all the time so you'll be constantly fighting whether the perk is up or not. Finally to round out the reload / damage perks you can use the easiest damage Nightshade has to offer, Collective Action. I find Kill Clip to be better as it's an ever so slightly higher damage bump. But depending on your build if you can create those elemental pickups it would be easier on Collective Action. Hatchling could work really well on Strand now that they received a slight buff.\n\nNightshade in PvP has had an interesting run. From being a viable option in Vanilla, to being passed over with random rolls, to being an off meta choice in its revival, to being outclassed, and finally returning again. What a ride. Arrowhead Brake is again my choice in barrels, but if you can control the recoil direction you can certainly opt for other options. Ricochet Rounds is the best in slot whenever it is available so please choose that. High-Caliber Rounds can work but I find neutrally the bump in stability outweighs possibly flinching off my opponent. In the third column it is all about Keep Away. Being able to get a range bump for free is incredible. I prefer Kill Clip for an easier time 1v2'ing as I am usually in a bad situation, but Headseeker is better neutrally for any 1vX situation as it's always on. With my roll choices you can have 100 recoil direction with a counterbalance mod and 32m of in game range. Plenty to take advantage of the bonuses of Keep Away.\nMasterworks: PvE: Stability PvP: Stability"

T-Ghoul, Centrifuse, Sunshot, or any legendary weapon you prefer. You won't be stuck using kinetic weapons with a great fusion.\n\nIn PvP there's a similar but not quite the same story. Under Pressure with Kickstart is going to be the main play, but Elemental Capacitor is also great for boosting some lower stats. I wouldn't take this fusion into PvP unless you know you like High-Impacts but it could serve you well, again, in loadout flexibility.\nMasterworks: PvE: Charge Time PvP: Range"

            "description": "Did anyone ask for more rapid-fire frame pulses? It wasn't on my Bingo card. Either way Oversoul Edict is here and requires Arrowhead Brake in order to even shoot reliably. Even with Arrowhead and a Counterbalance Stock you'll be just shy of perfect at 94 recoil direction. Definitely great, but it's a shame you'll have to sacrifice a mod to make it feel like it's shooting where you point it. In PvE Oversoul Edict doesn't have the best reload perks. Keep Away and Precision Instrument are both great, Demolitionist can be strong on grenade heavy builds. The reason why I want a good reload perk like Outlaw or Rapid Hit is because of Voltshot. Being able to clear rooms with Voltshot is becoming more and more fun, but having to reload to get the zaps is less fun.\n\nIn PvP your best bet is to invest fully into reliability perks. Arrowhead / CB mod for recoil direction. Ricochet Rounds for stability. Keep Away for more range and some extra accuracy. Headseeker to keep those bursts consistent. If you play a bit more aggressively I can see Eye of the Storm being a great additional perk but it's not my first choice.\nMasterworks: PvE: Stability PvP: Stability"

The best PvE option is actually a throwback repeat to one of my first \"DPS\" snipers. Does anyone remember the Long Shadow with Rapid Hit and Triple Tap being the best we could have in Forsaken until Black Armory introduced us to Firing Line. Persuader is the best option for the older perk combo, but is still outclassed by other snipers in the current Sandbox. Supremacy and Praedyth's Revenge are both incredible for damage, and any Firing Line sniper will compete with this one for decent damage.\n\nPersuader also falls behind in the Crucible. It does have access to Surplus to reach 100 handling but you would either have to have all 3 stacks or 2 stacks with full investment into handling to maintain ability usage while keeping 100 handling. If you can maintain all your Surplus stacks and invest the rest of your stats into range you'll have 87 range and 100 handling and reload speed. Still incredible but then you remember it's a rapid-fire frame meaning you can't crit supers or double body.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed"

I still think these bows are better for swapping but you let me know if you're finding success with lightweight blinting.

Incandescent for clearing rooms is another strong choice but I'm leaning towards Precision Instrument as the best in slot.\n\nPre Astyanax IV is not really meant for the crucible but you can achieve some really great stats through adept mods. Either lowering the draw time further or increasing the accuracy. Archer's Tempo is the best in slot, but you can pair that with a bunch of other perks like Opening Shot, Explosive Head, or even Successful Warm-Up for even faster follow up shots after a kill.\nMasterworks: PvE: Draw Time PvP: Draw Time"

Pre Astyanax IV is a solar bow rivaling Tyranny of Heaven and Strident Whistle, but neither can slot in adept mods. Adept Big Ones plus Precision Instrument will be an incredible combination. Incandescent for clearing rooms is another strong choice but I'm leaning towards Precision Instrument as the best in slot.\n\nPre Astyanax IV is not really meant for the crucible but you can achieve some really great stats through adept mods. Either lowering the draw time further or increasing the accuracy. Archer's Tempo is the best in slot, but you can pair that with a bunch of other perks like Opening Shot, Explosive Head, or even Successful Warm-Up for even faster follow up shots after a kill.\nMasterworks: PvE: Draw Time PvP: Draw Time"

Being one from the the highest damage archetype paired with Frenzy, or even Kill Clip you'll be able to have some great damage or stasis utility through Headstone. Outlaw is the best neutrally but Enlightened Action boosting the low handling will feel really nice.\n\nSo Psi Heretic V is a great PvP pulse. Don't believe me? You can hit 100 stability with Smallbore / Steady Rounds / Void Elemental Capacitor / Stability MW, and you have your fourth column perk to do with as you please. Perpetual Motion for more handling and reload, Headseeker for more forgiving bursts, Kill Clip for a bit of chaining, Headstone for Stasis shenanigans. The world is your oyster.

Increase the magazine size and slap on Arrowhead Brake for a really easy to use, high damage machine gun. Destabilizing Rounds will also do great as a single shot (in lower tiered content) will be able to kill an enemy and apply the debuff.\n\nThere are not many uses for a high-impact machine gun in PvP. They require all crits but just feel extremely unforgiving. Anything to bump up the consistency will be greatly appreciated. Dynamic Sway Reduction or Under Pressure, and Ricochet Rounds will feel great. Rampage might not be the best but it does allow you to 3 crit 1 body any resilience and 2 crit 2 body all the way up to 7 resilience. Adrenaline Junkie isn't quite as strong on the low end. But if you can get a grenade kill you can 3 crit any resilience for a 0.33s TtK. Incredibly fast.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Stability,"

Semiotician has way too many vowels to be considered healthy, but has a decent enough perk tool to keep it around. Enhanced Field Prep and Enhanced Explosive Light are going to be tried and true. Thanks to one of my Patrons, we discovered with one reserve mod and enhanced Bipod you can have 15 rockets in reserves. The last possible perk combination is Impulse Amplifier with Frenzy as once Frenzy gets going you won't need the reload, so the added velocity is appreciated here.\n\nHigh-Impact Frames are generally regarded as the best rocket archetype to use. Great blast radius for splash damage. Semiotician doesn't have any incredible AoE perks like Chain Reaction or Cluster Bomb for multikills but it does have Explosive Light to max out the blast radius, it's easy enough to get orbs, and you'll be able to nuke supers with Explosive Light.\nMasterworks: PvE: Velocity PvP: Handling"

Bait and Switch can put out some incredible damage, and you get to pair it with either Reconstruction or Rewind Rounds, both will extend your magazine and allow you to keep the DPS going. If you prefer less weapon swapping I would go Target Lock to keep damage up and really lay into that boss. Sword Logic or Voltshot are both great at clearing rooms and your choice will depend on how you feel about reloading a machine gun.\n\nMachine guns have not had a dominant presence in PvP since Hammerhead was sunset (RIP). You can make Song of Ir Yut feel great by bumping up all its stats. Elemental Capacitor will juice up Void or Arc builds while having slightly less utility on Stasis and negligible effects on Strand and Solar. I would argue it's better than Target Lock because you'll only be getting half a magazine in PvP but if the damage scales like I think it does, it could be incredible (I'll edit this if I am wrong.)\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload PvP: Range"

            "description": "Swordbreaker is the returning shotgun from Crota's End. Here we have a case of \"interesting but not incredible.\" Being able to get both Pugilist and One-Two Punch is a fantastic combo, but I feel that most people will opt for Subsistence to forget what reloading is like. Demolitionist is good for grenade heavy builds and also for forgetting the reload animation. In the final column, One-Two Punch is the best in slot, but on a Strand ability focused build you can get away with Golden Tricorn for even more damage. Sword Logic is also here if you want to run through enemies like Doom Guy and shotgun everything.\n\nSwordbreaker is interesting. It might take the place of the best lightweight frame shotgun. Being craftable, tying with the highest handling within its archetype, and being able to hit 100 range are just a few things that makes Swordbreaker interesting. You can choose a variety of different perks, you only need one handling perk and Threat Detector to hit 100 handling with an animation scalar, meaning you can invest the rest of your perks into range. Going with Smallbore, Accurized Rounds, and Opening Shot puts you at 91 range and 100 handling. Or you can opt for 100 range and 91 handling by swapping a few things around. The best part of this shotgun is its versatility.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload PvP: Handling,Range"

Lead from Gold and Heal Clip can be really nice additions too depending on your full loadout.\n\nI'm sure most people have seen u/Legoleflash's new video on the Eremite (if you haven't, go watch it here). Essentially the main point is enhanced Slickdraw doesn't feel terrible and allows you to full send into range. With Slickdraw maxing out your handling you can even opt for handling reducing perks like Full Bore, or, better yet, Extended Barrel for a bump in recoil direction. If you don't like Slickdraw there you could opt for Offhand Strike and find a good balance of range and stability.\nMasterworks: PvE: Charge Time PvP: Range,Charge Time"

            "description": "The Guiding Sight is similar to Nightshade with multiple revisions. Originally in Vanilla, and then dropping again in Season of the Hunt. Can we get a new gun? The Guiding Sight did lose one of its biggest attractors, the scopes you can select. Now with just barrels the best one is Arrowhead Brake to bring the recoil all the way to 100. Precision Instrument will be strong on this gun because you can keep a safe distance and still keep putting out incredible damage. Enlightened Action will also bring up the gun feel and help your reload.\n\nNow, while you can 3 crit at 0.80 at nearly every distance. I don't think this scout will be really strong in the close range. Fluted Barrel and Ricochet Rounds will bring up the low stats. Perpetual Motion and Enlightened Action will both boost your stats further and Kill Clip will allow you to 2 crit 1 body in the close range. It's not the strongest scout in the game. But it is now another high-impact scout with Kill Clip.\nMasterworks: PvE: Handling PvP: Stability"

            "description": "The Showrunner returns to us in an interesting time. I know I will be using it but that's because it can roll with an ever so elusive combination of Grave Robber and Swashbuckler. The Showrunner being the second lightweight frame with this combo and the first in the Kinetic Slot. For me this works well with all my titan builds and my titan brain. However, if you're not on a punch subclass or the master class then opting for something like Overflow and Kinetic Tremors will be a great combo. Overflow allows you to get 72 bullets per magazine, allowing for a whopping 7 Kinetic Tremor activations; and that's just at base. The only other weapon to get this combination is Buzzard but the lower magazine on Buzzard really holds it back, only getting 3 per overflow. This doesn't mean you can't get more than that by constantly walking over bricks to refill the magazine, but let's be honest I haven't done that subconsciously and I love Overflow.\n\nIn PvP The Showrunner is going to be the least used SMG this season right behind Unending Tempest. Go see why I think that SMG is better in the Vendor breakdown. The Showrunner has some great perks in Target Lock and Dynamic Sway Reduction, Rangefinder if you're really looking for consistency at range, or more neutral perks like Well Rounded or Heating Up. However, the issue is really the frame we were given. Lightweight SMGs are not \"in the spotlight.\" While I think this SMG can serve you well as a kinetic Funnelweb the perks to note aren't as strong. You can almost hit 100 range with Full Bore, Ricochet, Well Rounded 2x, and Fragile Focus, but that sacrifices Target Lock and Dynamic Sway Reduction for only 23m of range.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Stability"

            "description": "Another season, another bajillion perks in our core weapons. Unending Tempest comes in as the first core playlist 600 rpm submachine gun. We have had Aggressives come from Crucible and Gambit. Lightweights from Crucible and Vanguard. So no Precision Frames. The biggest synergy is Demolitionist and Adrenaline Junkie. Enlightened Action and any damage bonus will also feel incredible. And of course there's Subsistence and Frenzy for damage and never having to reload.\n\nUnending Tempest will be the next best submachine gun. Rivaling but not as strong as release The Immortal. The only issue is the large perk pool, but you can always work around that by playing crucible for more resets. The best perks depend on how you play. Killing Wind will help you get to and beat out your next engagement, Multikill Clip works here, but Kill Clip would have been better. Dynamic Sway Reduction will help keep your bullets on target paired with Target Lock for that quick TtK. Finally you could also try to hit max range with Fragile Focus and boost up your other stats with Perpetual Motion. It's definitely going to be a dominant SMG this season, and if you prefer precision SMGs like myself it will be worth the grind.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Range"

That's not a bad thing by the way. In PvE you'll want Fourth Time's the Charm, which should actually work on this gun, coupled with Vorpal Weapon for the highest damage and best mag utilization. For a more neutral weapon something like Enlightened Action and Frenzy for damage, reload, and handling all wrapped up into one.\n\nI would like to get my hands on a Warden's Law with Zen Moment to see if I can completely ignore stability as one trigger pull will grant my 4 stacks (2 per hit). It would feel incredible with that and Moving Target for more aim assist. Rampage and Kill Clip can both make the two burst easier and require less crits, but it won't be enough to one burst on its own. Kill Clip with a Ward of Dawn will be able to one burst dealing 124 to the head and 78 to the body. Really easy to down an enemy in record time.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Stability"

I guess I thought there were more. Word of Crota is an interesting 180. If you crafted a good IKELOS_HC_v1.0.3 then you won't need this one. If you didn't craft one, then this will be a great option. Subsistence as we know allows us to bypass the reload stat and your choice of damage perks will slot in perfectly. One combo to keep an eye on is the Repulsor Brace / Destabilizing Rounds combo. It won't scale up to GM levels but in entry level PvE activities it can put in great work.\n\nPrecision frame hand cannons are not meta in PvP. Killing Wind and a damage perk can make you competitive after a kill, but that's just it. It has to be after an initial kill. For most players a 120 or a 140 will do better, just keep in mind a grenade kill with Adrenaline Junkie puts you a 0.67s TtK only requiring 2 crits and 1 body shot. Similar to Kill Clip or old Not Forgotten / Luna's Howl era. You do need to get a grenade kill first, but it can wipe teams.\nMasterworks: PvE: Handling PvP: Range"

            "description": "Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really wouldn't take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just don't have the damage or the range you'd want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I'd recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you won't be able to shoot as far, but you're using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload. With such a small mag another great shout is multikill clip to keep damage stacks after each kill.\n\nIn PvP you can go one or two ways max range, or not quite max range. With rangefinder in the third column you can really opt for anything within that final column and be okay. Eye of the storm is a perfect pairing because you'll definitely be taking damage to get into sidearm range to begin with. Multikill clip gives you that slaying potential. If you wanted to invest fully into range you can do so and you'll hit 18.95m, but I'd suggest going to hammer-forged, losing that extra meter and dropping to 17.96 so you won't lose any stats. 18.95 m (max), 17.96 without losing stats"

Incandescent is a fantastic perk on autos as you don't always get that crit for dragonfly when you're spraying thrall or dregs (sorry Misraackskell). I'd also recommend going with ambitious assassin on everything just because it got a buff.\n\nI do not think Ammit is the play in PvP, precision frame autos have not been dominant since vanilla destiny 2 and I doubt we will see this archetype rise to any glory any time soon."

Wait just a second, Cold Front wasn't even Stasis. In PvE I think the absolute best combo is going to be ambitious assassin with headstone. Headstone kills do proc ambitious assassin for you to overload your magazine. It can be a little finicky but it does work. If you'd prefer non-Stasis oriented builds and a more neutral weapon you can go for the most punchy weapon this side of Titan (RIP Sloane). Grave robber or pugilist with swashbuckler is the play. Just make sure to have some stability so you won't be looking at Io (RIP Asher).\n\nIn PvP I don't think Blood Feud will replace other smgs, namely Huckleberry. You can get some interesting Stasis synergy with headstone, but Forensic Nightmare exists. Whether you prefer a 600 to a 750 is personal preference. I think elemental capacitor on either stasis, arc, or void is going to be one of the best feeling submachine guns to shoot."

            "description": "This is a fun little piece. Boudica-C is in the precision frame, meaning the slowest firing but hardest hitting sidearm archetype. It's a fine line between an overpowered sidearm and an underpowered hand cannon. This bridges the gap nicely while still feeling like a good sidearm. Again, I have to let you know sidearms are not meta, nor are they the best choice for middle to high-tier content. But they are damn fun and you should use what you like.\n\nIn PvP this archetype feels good when it works, but when it doesn't you feel like you're fighting the gun more than the newest hunter build. Swashbuckler will give you an incredibly forgiving time to kill, paired with moving target for the passive aim assist and strafe speed. If sidearm airborne effectiveness was fine enough to exist without major increases to feel good, I'd wholeheartedly recommend at least trying this sidearm in PvP, until then vault it for a rainy day."

Jokes aside, this sidearm is pure ecstasy, nothing less. Fun but not ideal in any serious content.\n\nIn PvP you can make Brigand's Law feel powerful. Rangefinder or adagio can make either the first or the second kill feel fantastic. With threat detector you'll know the extent of your range, but these sidearms melt within their intended ranges."

But it is unique in being one of three heavy weapons with incandescent. Of the three this is the easiest to get and one of the better weapons to get incandescent on. Roar of the Bear coming from Iron Banner is a rocket, which has better use cases. Fixed Odds coming from the Duality dungeon and feels impossible to farm for. Cry Mutiny gives this to players in an easy to get format.\n\nFor PvE I would use it with Solar builds, especially as one of your minor killing weapons. For PvP I would look elsewhere. The perks don't lend themselves to the best experience."

            "description": "Doom of Chelchis is probably the best void scout rifle we have seen in a while. Firefly and dragonfly is a hilarious combo, but another great combo is frenzy and explosive payload. Frenzy bumps up your reload to almost max, and explosive payload carries your damage a bit further. Another fun combo is explosive payload and one for all for easier activations. Vorpal in the third column also means you can get some insane damage combinations with one for all or focused fury. Definitely keep an eye out for this weapon.\n\nIn PvP I can see this scout being a niche but fun choice. Firefly and dragonfly plus radiant gives you discount chromatic fire in the energy slot. Not the most meta choice but I won't be mad if you kill me that way. You can also get the coveted \"fatebringer\" PvP roll in explosive payload and eye of the storm for dueling, but scout's aren't really the best choice for peek shooting and duels in that same capacity."

            "description": "Doom of Chelchis is probably the best void scout rifle we have seen in a while. Firefly and dragonfly is a hilarious combo, but another great combo is frenzy and explosive payload. Frenzy bumps up your reload to almost max, and explosive payload carries your damage a bit further. Another fun combo is explosive payload and one for all for easier activations. Vorpal in the third column also means you can get some insane damage combinations with one for all or focused fury. Definitely keep an eye out for this weapon.\n\nIn PvP I can see this scout being a niche but fun choice. Firefly and dragonfly plus radiant gives you discount chromatic fire in the energy slot. Not the most meta choice but I won't be mad if you kill me that way. You can also get the coveted \"fatebringer\" PvP roll in explosive payload and eye of the storm for dueling, but scout's aren't really the best choice for peek shooting and duels in that same capacity."

Mindbender's is an interesting PvE weapon. It can get incandescent and fills a similar niche to Without Remorse. I would happily craft myself a Without Remorse over trying to farm out an Adept Mindbender's Ambition. There really isn't any incentive to get this weapon this season.\n\nIn PvP you can make arguments for and against the return of Mindbender's Ambition. On one hand it's still a strong aggressive frame shotgun that can get adept mods. On the other hand so is the Timelost Found Verdict and VoG is less of a challenge. Master VoG will still kick an unprepared ass, but won't be nearly as difficult as it used to be. To make Mindbender's Ambition work in the crucible you'll have to invest into range and handling. Threat detector will take up a decent chunk of handling by speeding up the ready animation. But barrel shroud an a handling masterwork paired with quick charge will get you the rest of the way to where you want to be. Fragile focus and accurized rounds will take up your range, so long as you don't get hit to keep fragile focus up."

            "description": "While I'm happy Mindbender's Ambition makes a return, I would have rathered a new model or just a new gun. If you can't tell, I don't really like reissued sunset weapons. Mindbender's is an interesting PvE weapon. It can get incandescent and fills a similar niche to Without Remorse. I would happily craft myself a Without Remorse over trying to farm out an Adept Mindbender's Ambition. There really isn't any incentive to get this weapon this season.\n\nIn PvP you can make arguments for and against the return of Mindbender's Ambition. On one hand it's still a strong aggressive frame shotgun that can get adept mods. On the other hand so is the Timelost Found Verdict and VoG is less of a challenge. Master VoG will still kick an unprepared ass, but won't be nearly as difficult as it used to be. To make Mindbender's Ambition work in the crucible you'll have to invest into range and handling. Threat detector will take up a decent chunk of handling by speeding up the ready animation. But barrel shroud an a handling masterwork paired with quick charge will get you the rest of the way to where you want to be. Fragile focus and accurized rounds will take up your range, so long as you don't get hit to keep fragile focus up."

            "description": "I am excited for the synergy with this shotgun. This is the only shotgun to get headstone, and that makes it incredibly strong right out of the gate. Stasis synergy or not, having a pocket crystal whenever you want makes this very appealing. The crowd control from a stasis crystal or the add clearing potential is all right there. Whether you want a larger mag via triple tap, or faster reloads via feeding frenzy or outlaw. All are incredible choices.\n\nHeadstone also makes this the best legendary slug shotgun for PvP. Denying a res, or just applying slow to enemies after a shotgun kill creates openings only this shotgun can deliver. Another great build would be melee focused builds with pugilist and swashbuckler. Swashbuckler can one shot to the body with five stacks, made even easier with radiant or other damage boosting subclass perks. Keep an eye out for this weapon or craft one to your specifications."

            "description": "The newest crucible weapon is only the slightest bit a disappointment for me. It's an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you weren't around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it's not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds isn't going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time. But it might just be one of the best arc weapons to use with the new subclasses.\n\nThe crucible weapon is good in the crucible. Who would have thought that? Investing fully into range gives you 21.71 meters of effective range. Funnelweb still beats that out at 23.33 meters, but the Omolon trait of Omolon Fluid Dynamics will give you that extra stability in duels or at longer ranges. It will lose value as you start shooting, but that's where something like dynamic sway reduction or threat detector could come in to make it easier to shoot."

Add in either demolitionist or swashbuckler as your build allows and you've got a great feeling smg that opens up your energy slot for literally whatever.\n\nThe good pizza cutter does not stop at PvE, no it carves right through PvP like a hot pizza cutter through pizza (am I making you hungry yet?) Rangefinder and eye of the storm make it immediately competitive, but I would recommend bumping up the recoil direction to 100 through your choice of sauce, chambered compensator or extended barrel (input depending). Top it off with ricochet rounds, garnish it with a range masterwork. Cook it on high with your favorite shader. Boom bam, pizza cutter-22. You're welcome"

            "description": "Why must all the season pass machine guns be 900 rpm? They aren't bad, but they are my least favorite archetype. Give me Hammerhead 3.0 please. Planck's Strike needs a lot to feel good in any capacity. Harmony being its best damage perk next to swashbuckler is a big miss for me. One for All is easy to proc on a 900, but I'd rather use a primary ammo weapon for add clear 90% of the time. Keep it for collections, but don't actively farm for this weapon.\n\nPvP does not fare much better for the new machine gun. You can bump up the range, stability, and recoil direction and it still kicks like a drunken mule. That also takes away from eye of the storm, damage perks like rampage (not on this gun) or swashbuckler. 900 rpm machine guns need a lot of work just to feel good. Once they feel good, you remember 450s exist and move on to those."

            "description": "Pure Poetry is a fantastic addition to the 120 family. With both Crimil's Dagger and Steady Hand being removed from the Iron Banner loot pool there really is only Loud Lullaby in the kinetic slot. Pure Poetry isn't the best option, but it is nice to have it. The best benefit over Loud Lullaby is when you get a few resets in for your vanguard rep and have multiple perks within each column. For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference. Another great option is the newly buffed ambitious assassin to also circumvent the low mag / low reload speed. In the fourth column you can't go wrong with any number of damage perks. Frenzy, rampage, harmony, focused fury, multikill clip, or the new pugilist. Any and all of them are fantastic, but slightly player dependent.\n\nFor PvP I don't see this as a great replacement for Loud Lullaby. Not having kill clip is a big miss on this archetype for the crucible. It can, however, act as a pocket sniper for clean-ups or to prime targets for your team. Fragile focus and opening shot together will give you some insane ranges to blint or clean up targets."

But Bungie also knows that you can't craft a Commemoration or Corrective Measure. So I feel like it should have been a 450. Nevertheless it's here as a 360 and we have to like it. Arrowhead will max out the recoil direction, and firing line will give you that big damage. I don't feel comfortable recommending use of a 360 in a raid or dungeon for maximum damage, but in a strike I could see it being a solid option. Give it a try, the King's Fall weapons have the best scopes in all of Destiny (@ me I dare you).\n\nPlease don't use Qullim's in PvP, it is not what it used to be, you and I both know that. It's a shame, but it had to be done."

But Bungie also knows that you can't craft a Commemoration or Corrective Measure. So I feel like it should have been a 450. Nevertheless it's here as a 360 and we have to like it. Arrowhead will max out the recoil direction, and firing line will give you that big damage. I don't feel comfortable recommending use of a 360 in a raid or dungeon for maximum damage, but in a strike I could see it being a solid option. Give it a try, the King's Fall weapons have the best scopes in all of Destiny (@ me I dare you).\n\nPlease don't use Qullim's in PvP, it is not what it used to be, you and I both know that. It's a shame, but it had to be done."

            "description": "I wish legendary rocket launchers had more identities over just damage or single use boom sticks. Roar of the Bear is no exception to this rule. You can either set it up for maximum damage via field prep or demolitionist, paired with lasting impression, or vorpal weapon. OR set it up with chain reaction or incandescent and impulse amplifier so the boom gets there quicker. There really isn't anything interesting or new with rockets, so keep on going for the usual.\n\nSame thing in PvP. Legendary rockets have a lot to compete for when Wardcliff Coil, Gjallerhorn, Deathbringer, or even Two-Tailed Fox exist. If you're not using an exotic weapon, want to use a rocket, and aren't using one of those above, you're crazy. Legendary rockets have so much they need to do in order to even be thought of because they are one and done. If you can't secure that single kill, why not use an exotic rocket and know you'll get that kill."

But alas, it is simply another regular precision fusion rifle. Clown cartridge and vorpal weapon are the name of the game, but frenzy / rapid hit or focused fury / rapid hit are also just as good. I think this would be a great entry linear if Taipan-4fr or Stormchaser didn't exist alongside it.\n\nSailspy in PvP also falls a bit short. It doesn't come equipped with good single shot PvP perks like boxed breathing, opening shot, or even fragile focus. It does come with swashbuckler for easy one shot body shots after 3 stacks (up to 9 resilience, 4x for all resilience levels)."

It lowers the barrier for entry and to be competitive if you don't play trials or dungeons. I love this for Bungie. More ways for players to get competitive loot out of the gate. Firing line, frenzy, or focused fury are all incredibly strong options. Triple tap will refund you some ammo, clown cartridge will overflow your magazine, and if you can remember to crouch field prep will be your best option for reserves and a fast reload.\n\nTaipan-4fr is also great in PvP, fragile focus and opening shot stack to basically give you headshots. I'd recommend lowering the charge time to make it shoot quick, and increase the handling to make it feel quick. Keep an eye out for this or craft it and get those perks at level 1."

            "description": "I'm not super impressed with this scout rifle, it opens up your arsenal for other weapons being an arc Night Watch, but we do already have Eternal Blazon that everyone definitely already has, or Contingency Plan from Season of the Lost. Tarnished Mettle is a slight upgrade to Eternal Blazon, but not one everyone should go out and craft or farm it. By the end of the season everyone will have or have had a fantastic arc scout rifle, but until then I'd just stick to one of the other arc scouts.\n\nCrucible is not a nice home to 200 rpm scouts. In the MIDA archetype they fire fast, but aren't super special. You can roll explosive payload for better outgoing flinch, but if that made them meta you would have already seen a bunch of Night Watches in PvP. These scouts even with the best of rolls isn't anything to write home about."

            "description": "Yesteryear is a fun addition to the 390 archetype. I am slightly disappointed you need arrowhead brake to make this weapon feel good. Coupled with a counterbalance mod and you hit the sweet spot of 95. Outlaw makes a return as the best reload perk. Which is unfortunate seeing as rapid hit is objectively better. Subsistence is another great option but loses value in higher end content. Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time. Ambitious assassin with multikill clip is an extremely fun combination of increasing the magazine as well as increasing your damage at the same time.\n\nPvP is a slightly different story. You still want arrowhead brake and counterbalance to make this weapon feel smooth. Ricochet rounds are going to give you the best flinch resistance and stats. Perpetual motion will bring up the remaining stats the rest of the way, and rampage will allow you to two burst after a kill. If you want more of a dueling pulse you can opt for eye of the storm. Desperado makes an appearance on a different frame, but I don't see that as being the best choice for a lot of players as it makes the gun feel like two different weapons before or after a kill."

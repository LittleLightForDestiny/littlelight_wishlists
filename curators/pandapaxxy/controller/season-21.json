            "description": "A Distant Pull is an interesting sniper. Rapid-fire snipers aren't meta but this one could be incredibly strong to keep within your vault. Collective Action is an incredibly useful buff as it can be applied on any subclass. Headstone gives you some great cover and add control, but I find it far less useful on a sniper. Triple Tap gives you some great utility against majors, bosses, or vehicles where you can continuously crit them. I don't think this sniper will really shake up the meta, but it does offer some great utility on all classes. Jack of all trades, master of none.\n\nA Distant Pull is not going to be great in the Crucible. You can roll some really high handling, but without Snapshot Sights, some players won't even look at it, and being a rapid-fire other players won't even equip it. These snipers are not as dominant as they used to be before their double body nerf and haven't seen the sun since. Moving Target and Opening Shot will bump up your aim assist to 100 and you can craft this sniper for either 90 range or 90 handling. While it has some amazing stats, the frame and lack of snapshot will just put it under.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Handling"

            "description": "I am excited for this auto to pair with a void build using both Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds for a self buff and add clear. Golden Tricorn pairs well if you get Volatile from your subclass or just want a stronger weapon. Dragonfly in the third column will get beefed up with Golden Tricorn so I can see some utility outside of direct void explosions that could be usable all the way up to GM levels.\n\nIn PvP there are simply better options right now. Unlocking the patterns and getting them ready in the event of a buff would be wise, but quick killing weapons with good forgiveness coupled with Target Lock are the name of the game. Age-Old Bond kills quickly but does not have much in terms of forgiveness. Target Lock drops your 6 crit requirement down to 5 crit 1 body, not changing the time to kill, but making it ever so slightly more forgiving. With a bigger buff like Kill Clip you drop an entire shot needed to 4 crit 1 body. Not the most meta option.\nMasterworks: PvE: Range,Stability,Handling,Reload Speed PvP: Stability"

            "description": "Bug-Out Bag returns to us. I didn't love its original form, so let's see if this is the redemption arc of the century. In PvE you might enjoy a 100 recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the best call. All 900 RPM SMGs are bullet hoses, so I think that increasing the mag size is the best way to go. You could also completely circumvent reload through Subsistence. Another alternative is just bumping up your reload so the downtime between mags is reduced. Flared Magwell coupled with either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion will bring down your reload speed from 1.86s to either 1.32s with TD2x or 1.47s with PM2x. The easiest damage bonus is Collective Action this season as it neutrally pairs with every subclass. Incandescent works better on Solar builds but can neutrally clear rooms.\n\nAdaptive frame SMGs in PvP are not considered best of their class. Lightweights do the job better and within the same time to kill. Arrowhead Brake will keep the recoil direction vertical and make your shooting experience better. Ricochet Rounds gives a great boost to stability and range, Perpetual Motion will bring up a few more stats. The buff to Fragile Focus has made it an incredibly strong perk, I would look for that first to push the range out to 18.63m with this exact roll. You can get higher range if you prefer to compete more with Shayura's Wrath or Immortal.\nMasterworks: PvE: Stability PvP: Stability"

Arrowhead Brake will bring up that low recoil direction, and Rapid Hit will bring up the low stability and reload speed. Kinetic Tremors is what brings up Chattering Bone's utility. You could opt for sheer damage through Kill Clip and Focused Fury but I don't know if the two of those perks would work together. It might be a case of the curated where you have damage that starts at the top half and once that goes away you have damage by the bottom half.\n\nIn PvP Rangefinder pushes this pulse out to compete with some of the higher damage archetypes with more base range. Headseeker gives you forgiveness with each burst. You could opt for some really juicy stats with Elemental Capacitor, I wouldn't recommend Arc with the high base handling, but Void or Stasis could work really well.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Stability"

If you crafted a Bump in the Night you already have a good Chill Clip rocket launcher at your disposal. I like that Bait and Switch is on more weapons now and Explosive Light has taken over my heavy slot, so while there's an argument to upgrade past Bump in the Night, unless you get either of the other perks I would not worry about keeping a Chill Clip Cold Comfort.\n\nIn PvP I can't see any uses for this rocket. Without Impulse Amplifier there aren't a lot of reasons to use a legendary rocket launcher. You can net some sneaky multikills with Cluster Bomb but really I don't think this is a PvP rocket.\nMasterworks: PvE: Velocity PvP: Velocity"

Hand cannons are not the most meta weapon to use in higher level PvE, but Voltshot combined with a low magazine can make it reliable and give you a reason to reload this hand cannon. No reload perk hurts Combined Action, almost making it unusable. Eddy Current exists, but won't work with Voltshot, you need to be sprinting for 3 seconds to make it take effect.\n\nIn PvP having an energy 120 with Kill Clip seems like a perfect weapon, however, Combined Action has terrible base stats that cannot really be brought up through perks like Surplus, Keep Away or even Well Rounded. Zen Moment does bring up the stability, but I don't think it's worth it to try and chase.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload PvP: Stability"

Jurassic Green is lower but ends better at 50. With Arrowhead Brake and a CB mod you'll sit at 97 recoil direction. Subsistence will help you keep shooting at low tier activities, and Outlaw will have a slightly higher utility, but is far worse than Rapid Hit. Collective Action is the flavor of the season, but might catch a small nerf soon. Golden Tricorn is my next favorite perk but falls off with Strand not being able to reliably kill with every single ability. Which puts Multikill Clip as the best damage perk.\n\nIn PvP you'll still have to use Arrowhead Brake and a CB mod to make this even remotely competitive to its competition. Ricochet Rounds gives you a great stability bump and Moving Target or Headseeker are great neutral options.

            "description": "I don't think Epochal Integration is a great example of a World Drop, but it is from Neumona. I guess that counts, right? Epochal Integration is a set roll, so it makes my life a lot easier. Incandescent and Stats for All are your choices for PvE, you can proc Stats for All after one explosion kill, if that explosion tags two more enemies. In regular activities this is often and makes Epochal Integration feel amazing, the issue is you cannot refresh Stats for all, and when it does go away it makes the gun feel 1/4 as good.\n\nEpochal is honestly a great PvP gun. The issue is mostly the other guns it has to compete against. Palindrome and Exalted Truth are stat monsters and basically bully Epochal Integration into obscurity. It will be great if you never earned either of those hand cannons and is a good stepping stone for newer players. I wouldn't use this if you know you have better guns in your vault.\nMasterworks: PvE: Handling PvP: Handling"

While none of Glissando-47's stats are abnormal, the utility of the gun is already solid. Strand with Reconstruction or Overflow to never need to worry about reloading and paired with One for All or Box Breathing for better damage. Hatchling to better pair with Strand is another great combination. Scouts are designed to be safe options and this will feel incredibly strong to use.\n\nIn PvP you really only have one option compared to the many PvE options. Box Breathing for a blistering fast 0.67s TtK, rivaling the old Luna's Howl and Not Forgotten era. No Distractions will help with the flinch, and Arrowhead Brake will give you an easier follow up shot. Stability via your masterwork and Ricochet Rounds will also aid in making those three-taps a lot easier.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Stability"

Disruption Break is fantastic on a glaive for those ranged shields and keeps another good perk like Incandescent. It's no longer an either-or. Redirection will be really strong on Greasy Luck if you use it right, I do not know how it interacts with the melee, so you'll have to report back to me on that one use case.\n\nIn PvP I can see more blinting possibilities with Greasy Luck. Tied with the highest base handling at 61 with Unexpected Resurgence and shooting faster I can see a lot of players using this weapon to swap almost like a bow, but with a shield. Opening Shot also makes this a really compelling argument. With Disruption Break you can swap to your kinetic and deal 50% more damage, the projectile for Greasy Luck does 105 damage, almost enough to break all tier's shields. Could be fun, let me know how it feels glaive users.\nMasterworks: PvE: Shield Duration PvP: Range,Shield Duration"

I wish this was either a new archetype entirely or another aggressive frame. Regular linear fusion rifles just don't feel as good to me anymore, and the huge perk pool just feels unrewarding now. You can craft Taipan and you're basically done. Strand is nice for breaking the few shields, but the removal of match game belittles strand damage types for now.\n\nIn PvP if you didn't craft a Taipan, you just missed the mark entirely. Buffed Fragile Focus and Opening Shot for great range and specifically what you want? Instant shards for Laser Painter.\nMasterworks: PvE: Charge Time PvP: Range,Charge Time"

            "description": "Last Foray is a fodder sniper. It exists as both legendary shards and has some incredibly niche use cases. The first of which is a rapid-fire sniper with the damage of an aggressive with Cascade Point. You will certainly want to bump up the mag to at least 5 in order to take some advantage of it. Envious Assassin can also help you out here as both perks require other weapon kills to activate. The second of which is with Lead from Gold builds, the only issue with this is that most of the best weapons for double special builds reside in the energy slot. I would hate to break a LfG build by using just bad weapons for it. Last Foray is good, but incredibly niche.\n\nIn PvP you lose Snapshot Sights, which is an instant shard for most players. Invested fully into handling you can bump up to 100, but at that point you're stuck with one subclass and barely any wiggle room. I am sure some of you will do well with this sniper in PvP, however, even Adored will fare better to most players.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Handling"

            "description": "Last Rite is very much a solid Ritual Weapon. It doesn't exist as an incredibly strong scout, but it does come with a solid set of perks. Reconstruction and Focused Fury do allow you to use a legendary 120 RPM scout rifle in PvE without it being Dead Man's Tale. I cannot think of many situations where that's necessary, nor really a need to use a 120 RPM scout. This does break up the need for an exotic as both Long Arm and Last Rite are legendary and therefore allow some loadout variation. However, the lack of specific perks like Rapid Hit, Explosive Payload, Kill Clip, or even Kinetic Tremors would bump this scout way up into usage. It's certainly one of the scouts of all time.\n\nLast Rite does not fare any better in PvP. Dead Man's Tale is the best 120 RPM scout and has hip firing capabilities. All other legendary 120s feel fine while hip firing but feel night and day different comparatively. Keep Away feels like a throw away perk because scouts barely need any range. Rapid Hit would bump Last Rite up for me, but Reconstruction could work. I would not use this for hip firing but as a classic scout I wouldn't be upset with a teammate using this.\nMasterworks: PvE: Range,Stability,Handling,Reload Speed PvP: Range,Stability,Handling,Reload Speed"

            "description": "The new competitive weapon is a sniper, and while there are a lot of perks to look out for, I don't think your main priority should be PvE. Snipers dedicated for PvE have ammo refreshing perks and a solid damage perk. Discord is nice, but require constant kills in order to keep up their utility. Snipers for damage don't usually get constant flows of kills, and snipers for add clear (if you're one of those odd balls, like me) need a better AoE damage perk. Mercurial Overreach is a PvP sniper.\n\nIn PvP you'll find a lot of Guardians opting for the tried and true Snapshot Sights and Opening Shot Combo. With the right investments (aka all handling) you can have the most coveted sniper perks alongside 92 handling. Almost making this the fastest sniper in the game, but certainly one with both Snapshot Sights and Opening Shot at the same time. The Supremacy can also reach 92, but that's on a rapid-fire frame. Defiance of Yasmin (Harrowed) can reach 82 but that is with adept mods. Silicon Neuroma (Adept) is the highest aggressive frame at 59. On an adaptive sniper, this is the highest handling you can get without using things like Dragon's Shadow, Ophidians, or even Slickdraw.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Handling"

Discord pulls ammo from thin air and can help when in lower activities to bypass reloading.\n\nThere aren't a lot of hand cannons that see top tier usage in PvP. Opening Shot, Keep Away, and Perpetual Motion in one column, and Explosive Payload and Kill Clip in the other make for a stacked package. Add in enhanced perks and you have a recipe for a super solid hand cannon. Eye of the Storm or Fragile Focus would round out the mix for best perks on a hand cannon, but overall it's a solid choice. Hard to say if this is stronger than Palindrome and Exalted Truth, but it certainly holds its own. You'll have to fight some of the weird gun model though.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Stability"

            "description": "New Pacific Epitaph is our newest Stasis grenade launcher, at first I was disappointed with no Chill Clip, but then I saw why. A wave frame GL. This brings back up my excitement. Wave frame grenade launchers are arguably the best GL to bring into any content. They are easy to use, reliable, and unless the architecture messes with you very easy to secure multikills with. Collective Action is the best for subclass agnostic builds. Redirection will make easy work of bigger targets, and hordes building up that damage. Kill Clip is simple because you always have to reload to fire.\n\nIn PvP there aren't many good perks here. Perpetual Motion is solid, but not a replacement for Auto-Loading Holster. Adrenaline Junkie can build up that damage for the highest damage but won't one shot a tier 10 guardian. Kill Clip and Harmony do less than Adrenaline Junkie 5x in that order\nMasterworks: PvE: Velocity PvP: Velocity"

It does open up a few different build capabilities with Demolitionist and Adrenaline Junkie for those grenade builds.\n\nNo Survivors is Immortal but energy. They feel similar, they both get Target Lock and Rangefinder. I would almost argue that No Survivors is better, but that might be because my vault has a lot of kinetic special weapons. It does open up loadouts which I love to see.

Reliable was the name of the game back in Vanilla. In today's world the best roll to look out for is similar to Rufus's Fury. The benefit Old Sterling has is in its frame. Being an adaptive frame might feel better to some users compared to Rufus;s Fury being a rapid-fire frame. Entirely dependent on how you like to shoot. Frenzy and Demolitionist I listed as being better perks only because Hatchling falls off incredibly quick on non-Strand builds. The extra damage from the Threadlings are nice, but don't pack as much of a punch without Strand to buff them.\n\nAdaptive autos have not been meta in quite a while. It was back when Hard Light was too strong that adaptive autos felt like they had a place. What a weird time to be playing Destiny. It was like a light show all the time in PvP. Nowadays you're going to have to do a lot to make adaptive autos feel strong. Surplus will bring up all your stats. Harmony when paired with a special weapon can also make multikills feel like a breeze if you couple the two. A fast handling, good feeling auto with a damage bump. Takes a lot to make this auto work, but I'm sure someone wants to.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Stability"

            "description": "Outlast is a great gun with awful stats. Arrowhead Brake is almost mandatory for bringing up the low recoil direction, but you might also want to throw on a CB mod for 100 recoil direction. Flared Magwell would be good for the stat bump and reload speed. Feeding Frenzy is the best for not needing precision hits, but Outlaw is great in the event that you can handle the bounce. Kill Clip is an easy 25%, but you could also opt for solar grenade builds with Demolitionist, or Dragonfly for some better add clear.\n\nIn PvP you will still want Arrowhead Brake. Ricochet Rounds is perfect for bringing up the low stability. Rangefinder currently is best in slot and you can couple that with Kill Clip for bonus damage. Competing slightly with Horror's Least and slightly with Autumn Wind.\nMasterworks: PvE: Stability PvP: Stability"

Nothing better than old reliable Kill Clip from Curse of Osiris. This new version gives us access to Golden Tricorn, Destabilizing Rounds, and even Repulsor Brace making it a really great void option for anyone drawn to the void. Ambitious Assassin isn't a replacement for reload, but it does help make reloads feel a bit further away instead of making them faster.\n\nIn PvP I cannot reliably see a way to make Positive Outlook meta. Tap the Trigger and Kill Clip will give you the best footing for multikills and sprees. Eye of the Storm also helps win duels for a more consistent 1v1 experience. Both Zen Moment and Dynamic Sway Reduction could swap in for Tap the Trigger as your consistency perk.\nMasterworks: PvE: Stability PvP: Stability"

I do enjoy seeing older ritual / pinnacle weapons refreshed with more options, especially post sunsetting. It does feel good grinding them out again. Randy's Throwing Knife was the best rapid-fire scout for its time but unfortunately fell into a time where scouts were just awful to use and did not have a set place outside of MIDA Multi-Tool or a few specific options. Randy's Throwing Knife with Kinetic Tremors will feel great as it fires fast enough to get the AoE back to back. Cascade Point is really funny to me, seeing a 260 scout bumping the RPM all the way up to 428 via D2Foundry. If this lands for me I don't even really care about viability, it will just be fun.\n\nRandy's Throwing Knife did find its slight niche within PvP, hopefully the new version delivers. I think it does and then some. The old version had Rapid Hit and Kill Clip, which you can get again, but with Extended Mag instead of a better mag boosting perk. You also have the option of bumping up the recoil direction making those quick headshots a lot easier. While the old Randy's Throwing Knife didn't have a bad roll, getting it again with slightly better options feels good.\nMasterworks: PvE: Stability PvP: Stability"

            "description": "The only problem with this submachine gun is the far too low stability. Rapacious Appetite has literally the lowest stability across all submachine guns in the game at 6. A whopping 6. You're going to want to bump that up even on MnK. You can drop the stability to zero, but I wouldn't recommend it. Well-Rounded does give some great stability to bring up Rapacious Appetite's extremely low stability. One for All is the easiest damage bonus to get as you won't need to get kills and your low stability will occasionally make crit kills harder, making Headstone less optimal. Frenzy also brings up your damage and reload which really helps out.\n\nIn PvP your best bet is Target Lock for the added damage and Encore for more stats. Perpetual Motion and Well-Rounded are also great for boosting stats. I really think you should be bringing up the stability as much as you can while maintaining as much range as possible.\nMasterworks: PvE: Stability PvP: Stability"

Field Prep will bump up your reserves and also increase your reload speed. Outlaw only works on kills so it will be better if you pair it with Voltshot. Focused Fury or Vorpal Weapon are interchangeable because Focused Fury needs hits to start getting high damage, but Vorpal Weapon does less damage but is immediate.\n\nI loved Sole Survivor. My roll has over 800 PvP kills. The reprisal lost Opening Shot which immediately kills this sniper for me. It was introduced with Mercurial Overreach which I think was the PvP sniper Bungie wanted people to grind for, but I am upset I can't use my old one and the new one doesn't have the same perk pool. The best roll to get is with high handling and Snapshot. Eye of the Storm is the best in slot here.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Handling"

In order to make this hand cannon work in PvE you'll want to use Rapid Hit for more stability and more importantly the reload bonus. Kinetic Tremors gives this hand cannon utility in higher tier activities. Vorpal Weapon can be used in lower tier activities against majors but I wouldn't bring Spare Rations into a GM. Focused Fury will give you some great damage to clear red bars and majors if you wanted to, but Spare Rations just isn't good enough for higher tiered activities.\n\nIn PvP Spare Rations could make itself a small niche. It feels great to handle and has some great sights for solid 3-taps. It will not be able to out-range most of its competitors, but it will be able to comfortably out-handle most of them. Spare Rations beats out Thorn for handling and almost reaches 100 handling naturally.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Stability"

            "description": "There aren't many places I see myself using a grenade launcher in PvE nowadays. Cascade Point is very fun and Full Court will net you some solid damage from afar, but I find myself using rockets over grenade launchers. Maybe for GMs or activities where ammo is a bit more scarce and using a rocket launcher wouldn't be the best choice. Explosive Light really is carrying my weapons this season.\n\nIn PvP you could definitely surprise a few players with an extra rapid rapid-fire frame grenade launcher with Cascade Point, but I find those groupings to be way less common than you think. Otherwise I would just go for Disruption Break to enhance my kinetic weapon.\nMasterworks: PvE: Blast Radius PvP: Blast Radius"

            "description": "Targeted Redaction has a subpar perk pool. You can make this hand cannon work with Outlaw for faster reloads and your choice of fourth column perk. Collective Action gives you great damage without having to spec into any specific subclass. Destabilizing Rounds is fun with stacking void debuffs. Explosive Payload will help mitigate some damage fall off, which helps hand cannons in higher level activities, it also adds some outgoing flinch. I would probably take this perk last as other perks will be better overall, but it does help in PvE.\n\nIn Crucible there is a small problem with this hand cannon, Behemoth Titan, and Collective Action. If you use this, you know who you are, you're going to get Collective Action Nerfed.* I hope it stays a 20% bonus in PvE, but it could be reduced there due to the PvP side. For a more neutral 120, Well-Rounded and Keep Away will bump up your stats and make this hand cannon feel a little less like a truck flailing in the wind when you use it.\n\n*Edit, you did it, you got it nerfed.

I don't say that often but given all the goodies of double damage perks, craftability, and great stats you can really have it your way. Rewind Rounds coupled with Collective Action for subclass agnostic buffs, Controlled Burst for laying down enemies or Golden Tricorn when on Arc will feel incredibly strong. Reconstruction is a tried and true gem of a perk, only beaten by my obsession with Overflow. Kill Clip can stack with all of these creating over 100% damage increases with Kill Clip, Golden Tricorn 2x, 3 Surge Mods, and Major Spec. If you set things up right you can almost have a 150% damage increase. Simply put it is the best fusion in the game for damage and has greater utility beyond that.\n\nIn PvP you could also recommend Techeun Force as the best fusion in the game and I will. Arrowhead Brake with a CB mod brings the recoil to 100, so you can invest the rest of the fusion into range via Projection Fuse and Rangefinder. If you value kill chaining you could go for Reconstruction and Controlled Burst for never reloading and getting that 20% damage increase. Another niche use case would be Kill Clip and Kickstart for a nice 4 bolt kill, you'd have to be sprinting immediately after reloading but the enhanced version extending Kill Clip's timer will help you out.\nMasterworks: PvE: Charge Time PvP: Range"

If swords were more utilized in content it could be really fun with Chain Reaction for explosions, or your choice of Golden Tricorn or Collective Action for some really solid damage. You could potentially set up Thin Precipice for huge damage with surge mods and two stacks of Golden Tricorn to melt champions or even bosses. It's niche and would require more set up than your average boss killing weapon, but it would be crazy to see/\n\nIt's going to be a similar story to Just In Case for PvP. Unfortunately you have to make a choice this time. Either Valiant Charge or Tireless Blade. Personally I think Tireless is the best choice but I know people like harnessing their inner Sanic. Chain Reaction could potentially net you some double kills. Zoom in, get a double or more? I can see the montage now.\nMasterworks: PvE: Impact PvP: Impact"

            "description": "Transfiguration is a really solid scout mixed in with other really good scouts. Unfortunately, other scouts with similar rolls are already in most players' hands so there's less of a reason to grind for this. Rapid Hit and Kinetic Tremors already exists on Hung Jury and most players like the precision archetype better than the high-impact archetype. Explosive Payload is a tried and true perk combo that works here too. The enhanced versions of Rapid Hit and Explosive Payload don't add a ton to the weapon.\n\nIn PvP there aren't a ton of reasons to use a high-impact scout. Jade Rabbit and Polaris Lance were dominant but not as strong any more. The rise and fall of scouts are typically accompanied by a slower game, pulses and SMGs are dominant right now because you're either playing passively or aggressively, there aren't too many middle avenues. Scouts cater to the former but on a higher end. If you do want to try this scout out in PvP you will need more than just Explosive Payload and some prayers.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed"

            "description": "Tyranny of Heaven used to be the only solar bow in the game, and its sights are really odd. In its current version you can certainly get some good mileage out of the updated perks, only if you can agree with the wonky sights. Archer's Tempo will get you the best reload / knock time, and Golden Tricorn is simply the best damage perk in the game. On solar that job gets even easier with the plethora of amazing abilities. Collective action will have slightly less uptime but could still be considered one of the better perks. Incandescent does give you some great AoE but I find that not bumping up the bow's innate damage might feel a bit lackluster in higher end activities.\n\nIn PvP please just don't use bows. The only way to one shot a guardian in PvP is by stacking 3 surge mods with Swashbuckler, or getting Golden Tricorn 2x going. While it is possible, and arguably sustainable within PvP it is incredibly niche. You can go a tried and true route with Snapshot Sights and any of the good third column perks but I would just use a precision frame instead.\nMasterworks: PvE: Draw Time PvP: Draw Time"

Prove me wrong with this glaive.\n\nIn PvP glaive users might find a niche with adept mods being present on the first ever adept glaive. While there are at least 3 of you I might finally encounter a wild glaive in the crucible. If you are set on using glaives in PvP you do not need me to tell you what works and what doesn't.\nMasterworks: PvE: Shield Duration PvP: Range"

You can opt for any of the mag bonuses to hit cap in order to slot in a Major or Boss Spec mod. Other options include Collective Action for a small everything buff, or Vorpal Weapon to stack with your spec mod.\n\nIn PvP you're much better off using a different weapon as rapid-fire frames need two shots to reliably kill from a distance. If you are okay with that, then investing fully into handling and harmony for better damage after a kill would give you the best chance at competing with precision and aggressive frame shotguns.\nMasterworks: PvE: Reload Speed PvP: Handling"

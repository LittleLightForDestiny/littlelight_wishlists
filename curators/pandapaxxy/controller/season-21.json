Collective Action is an incredibly useful buff as it can be applied on any subclass. Headstone gives you some great cover and add control, but I find it far less useful on a sniper. Triple Tap gives you some great utility against majors, bosses, or vehicles where you can continuously crit them. I don't think this sniper will really shake up the meta, but it does offer some great utility on all classes. Jack of all trades, master of none.\nMasterworks: Reload Speed"

Unlocking the patterns and getting them ready in the event of a buff would be wise, but quick killing weapons with good forgiveness coupled with Target Lock are the name of the game. Age-Old Bond kills quickly but does not have much in terms of forgiveness. Target Lock drops your 6 crit requirement down to 5 crit 1 body, not changing the time to kill, but making it ever so slightly more forgiving. With a bigger buff like Kill Clip you drop an entire shot needed to 4 crit 1 body. Not the most meta option.\nMasterworks: Stability"

In PvE you might enjoy a 100 recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the best call. All 900 RPM SMGs are bullet hoses, so I think that increasing the mag size is the best way to go. You could also completely circumvent reload through Subsistence. Another alternative is just bumping up your reload so the downtime between mags is reduced. Flared Magwell coupled with either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion will bring down your reload speed from 1.86s to either 1.32s with TD2x or 1.47s with PM2x. The easiest damage bonus is Collective Action this season as it neutrally pairs with every subclass. Incandescent works better on Solar builds but can neutrally clear rooms.\nMasterworks: Stability"

Jurassic Green is lower but ends better at 50. With Arrowhead Brake and a CB mod you'll sit at 97 recoil direction. Subsistence will help you keep shooting at low tier activities, and Outlaw will have a slightly higher utility, but is far worse than Rapid Hit. Collective Action is the flavor of the season, but might catch a small nerf soon. Golden Tricorn is my next favorite perk but falls off with Strand not being able to reliably kill with every single ability.

Tied with the highest base handling at 61 with Unexpected Resurgence and shooting faster I can see a lot of players using this weapon to swap almost like a bow, but with a shield. Opening Shot also makes this a really compelling argument. With Disruption Break you can swap to your kinetic and deal 50% more damage, the projectile for Greasy Luck does 105 damage, almost enough to break all tier's shields. Could be fun, let me know how it feels glaive users.\nMasterworks: Range, Shield Duration"

Reconstruction and Focused Fury do allow you to use a legendary 120 RPM scout rifle in PvE without it being Dead Man's Tale. I cannot think of many situations where that's necessary, nor really a need to use a 120 RPM scout. This does break up the need for an exotic as both Long Arm and Last Rite are legendary and therefore allow some loadout variation. However, the lack of specific perks like Rapid Hit, Explosive Payload, Kill Clip, or even Kinetic Tremors would bump this scout way up into usage. It's certainly one of the scouts of all time.\nMasterworks: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed"

All other legendary 120s feel fine while hip firing but feel night and day different comparatively. Keep Away feels like a throw away perk because scouts barely need any range.

Reliable was the name of the game back in Vanilla. In today's world the best roll to look out for is similar to Rufus's Fury. The benefit Old Sterling has is in its frame. Being an adaptive frame might feel better to some users compared to Rufus;s Fury being a rapid-fire frame. Entirely dependent on how you like to shoot. Frenzy and Demolitionist I listed as being better perks only because Hatchling falls off incredibly quick on non-Strand builds. The extra damage from the Threadlings are nice, but don't pack as much of a punch without Strand to buff them.\nMasterworks: Reload Speed"

Randy's Throwing Knife was the best rapid-fire scout for its time but unfortunately fell into a time where scouts were just awful to use and did not have a set place outside of MIDA Multi-Tool or a few specific options. Randy's Throwing Knife with Kinetic Tremors will feel great as it fires fast enough to get the AoE back to back. Cascade Point is really funny to me, seeing a 260 scout bumping the RPM all the way up to 428 via D2Foundry. If this lands for me I don't even really care about viability, it will just be fun.\nMasterworks: Stability"

Well-Rounded does give some great stability to bring up Rapacious Appetite's extremely low stability. One for All is the easiest damage bonus to get as you won't need to get kills and your low stability will occasionally make crit kills harder, making Headstone less optimal.

The rise and fall of scouts are typically accompanied by a slower game, pulses and SMGs are dominant right now because you're either playing passively or aggressively, there aren't too many middle avenues. Scouts cater to the former but on a higher end. If you do want to try this scout out in PvP you will need more than just Explosive Payload and some prayers.\nMasterworks: Stability"

In its current version you can certainly get some good mileage out of the updated perks, only if you can agree with the wonky sights. Archer's Tempo will get you the best reload / knock time, and Golden Tricorn is simply the best damage perk in the game. On solar that job gets even easier with the plethora of amazing abilities. Collective action will have slightly less uptime but could still be considered one of the better perks. Incandescent does give you some great AoE but I find that not bumping up the bow's innate damage might feel a bit lackluster in higher end activities.\nMasterworks: Draw Time"

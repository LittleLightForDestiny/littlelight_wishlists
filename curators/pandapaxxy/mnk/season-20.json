            "description": "Allied Demand is extremely similar to Buzzard, however, there will be no adept mods to bring up stats or damage in PvE. Rapid Hit is by and large the best perk to look for. Subsistence is also good if you're in lower tiered PvE. Frenzy is the best in slot perk with either third column perk. Multikill Clip pairs better with Rapid Hit than Subsistence.\n\nIn PvP you can have near 100 range and an 18.71m range. However, if you opt for a different barrel instead of Full Bore you can still maintain an 18m range drop off. If you prefer a bit more stability, even just Rapid hit 3x and Iron Reach can keep the stability respectable at 56. Still less than the base of 67 but the added benefits of an increasing stability in a gunfight can give you the edge."

            "description": "Autumn Wind is a fun return to our sandbox. Arrowhead Brake is a must have on these pulses. 93 recoil direction is near perfect for PvE, but I would hesitate to bring a rapid-fire frame into higher end PvE. Demolitionist and Frenzy are great on grenade heavy builds. Freny brings up the reload so you won't have to invest hard into that one particular stat.\n\nIt's always fun when a weapon drops where it should perform. Arrowhead Brake and a counterbalance mod bring up the recoil direction to 100. Ricochet Rounds will bring up the stability or you can push out more flinch with High-Caliber Rounds. Rangefinder is in slot, but you can always increase your range through Killing Wind or more stability through Heating Up. If you would like a more stat boosted weapon you can roll with Elemental Capacitor and choose how this gun reacts."

            "description": "Basso Ostinato is an interesting shotgun. We have gotten a few new aggressive frame shotguns recently, especially within this DLC. The interesting thing about this shotgun is the inclusion of Nanotech Tracer Rockets pushes this shotgun a little over the edge compared to its brothers and sisters. You will want to increase Basso Ostinato's handling to make swaps a lot less painful. Envious Assassin and Grave Robber are great options depending on what you're using this shotgun for and with. If you are using Basso Ostinato as a DPS weapon or mob killer, then something like Trench Barrel or Destabilizing Rounds will be perfect with Envious Assassin. If you punch a lot you can pair Grave Robber with either of the punchy perks.\n\nBasso Ostinato does not compete well in PvP. Opening Shot does make up one of the two incredible shotgun perks. However, Perpetual Motion does not stack up as well compared to Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion 2x is still not even as strong of a handling buff as Threat Detector 1x. You will want to crank up the handling as much as possible. You will be okay using this shotgun at its possible version, however, you will just do better with a more dedicated PvP shotgun."

Battle scar was not utilized much in year 1, this season it has some utility in Kinetic Tremors for clearing groups. If you're hurting for a good PvE pulse this will suffice. There are much better dedicated rolls, but this will do just fine.\n\nIn PvP lightweight frame pulses are not meta. They are usable with damage perks. Battle Scar gets Multikill Clip for damage and Eye of the Storm for consistency. Depending on what you value you could swing it either way."

It's not a dedicated high-dps weapon for raid bosses, but could be better for GMs or general strikes.\n\nOne quick roll to get out of the way is Slickdraw with either Opening Shot or Moving Target. With Slickdraw you can invest entirely into range and get 100 range and 100 handling even before Opening Shot. Moving Target will be more passive and grant you +10 Aim Assist. Snapshot and Opening Shot are the bread and butter rolls most Guardians will opt for, but keep an eye out for Slickdraw."

They might not always be meta but they feel good to shoot without investing a lot into their stats. If you run Arrowhead Brake you will have perfect recoil, Envious Assassin will overflow the magazine. Target Lock or Vorpal Weapon will be dependent on whether or not you use this as a boss killer or multi-tool. You could also make this your add-clearing machine with Hatchling and Feeding Frenzy.\n\nIf you would like a more PvP focused weapon you can roll with Target Lock and Keep Away for some great range and damage. Offhand Strike and Eye of the Storm is for Cammycakes to show us montages for how to use it. Niche but definitely doable."

A slightly higher range slower rpm auto instead of submachine gun. You can roll Envious Assassin if you swap weapons a lot, or Feeding Frenzy for pure reload speed. Incandescent for clearing rooms and Target Lock for damage against champs or majors.\n\nUnfortunately, this utility and convenience doesn't carry over to PvP. Target Lock is the only thing that makes Coronach-22 viable and that recently changed to make it less forgiving. If you can consistently hit your crits then you can make any auto rifle work. This will be great for higher skilled players but be harder to use for less skilled players."

Dragonfly gives you some great add clear potential with Veist Stinger to keep up the shooting, pair that with Subsistence and you can almost non-stop firing. Titans Rejoice a legendary Sweet Business that has 'splosions!\n\nIn PvP 720s aren't super meta, but they are consistent, fun and surprisingly lethal.

Or Destabilizing Rounds for better add clear while maintaining some good damage. Lots to do with more utility over Guillotine which was only damage.\n\nIn PvP you're either using a sword for Eager Edge, or because you really like legendary swords. Valiant Charge is fun and can throw your enemies off. Spin-to-win swords aren't really meta in the crucible but it can also destroy bubble titans and well warlocks."

The only thing keeping me from using it more is Bungie's floor textures sending the wave in every direction but the enemy. Envious Assassin and Chain Reaction can be really fun for using this grenade launcher as a mock add-clear weapon when swapping between weapons. Field Prep and Vorpal Weapon would be interesting for boss damage if the boss is reliably on the ground.\n\nI did not test this grenade launcher for a long period of time in PvP, but the same thing kept creeping into my mind. Having a heavy weapon that doesn't one shot like its archetype siblings is just wrong. Having to fire twice and rely on architectures and level surfaces to kill is incredibly unfun. Do not use this in PvP until it gets a damage buff. Disruption Break is the perk for now as it will reliably break shields.\n\nI might update this once Dimensional Hypotrochoid gets a buff."

Rangefinder and Eye of the storm are best in slot and you already knew that. I don't need to say much more."

It's unfortunate that Goldtusk is hunter specific as getting Valiant Charge with another great add clearing perk like Chain Reaction gives this sword no choice between movement or add clear. One for All is also great for dealing better shatter damage against bosses.\n\nThe extra intrinsic lightweight plus Valiant Charge gives this the spood to outclass any Eager Edge sword. Again, a damn shame it's hunter only."

Ensemble will be with a group and as long as you're near them. Slideshot can be good for solo play. Dual loader would be good if you know you'll only be reloading outside of combat.\n\nIn PvP you can crank up your handling to near 100, and then add in some dexterity mods for better animations. Hand in Hand won't have the deepest OHK but it will have some great handling when fully invested. Might not be the for clean ups, but will feel lightning quick on an arc subclass."

            "description": "It's fun to see more Truthteller clones out in the wild. Harsh Truths competes with Truthteller and all the other wave frame GLs. Truthteller served me very well in a lot of GM attempts so I'm expecting a lot from this GL. Disruption Break was extremely strong and Destabilizing Rounds looks to be even stronger. Especially paired with Envious Assassin for a larger magazine you can two shot without even getting a kill with this GL.\n\nDisruption Break makes or breaks this GL in PvP. It does just enough damage to break shields which will give you that 50% damage bonus to your kinetic. You could try going for Envious Assassin for those two shots but I think Threat Detector is just simpler to use."

Your damage is already strong per shot and you're making it even stronger with a spec mod, surge mods, and surrounded. Auto-Loading Holster is for stow and shoot. But Surplus can bring up your handling and reload speed if you don't use your abilities often.\n\nTruthfully I'm excited to use this shotgun in PvP. Crafted with max handling and enhanced Threat Detector and enhanced Opening Shot will make for a very very quick and consistent kill. Shape it with high handling and Opening Shot will take care of your range. This will make for an incredibly fast handling shotgun with some solid range and feel."

Irukandji does have access to Veist Stinger for potentially more shots but I wouldn't rely on that being the deal breaker.\n\nIn PvP you can get a roll identical to Father's Sins and similar to Praedyth's Revenge. Father's Sins does have lower zoom and is craftable for enhanced perks / enhanced intrinsic perk. The good news is that Irukandji is Stasis and Father's Sins is Void so they won't compete. In that realm you're looking at Praedyth's Revenge which can get adept mods (should you have the adept version). If you have the adept version you can have incredibly high stats, 100 handling and 100 aim assist. Irukandji is great if you don't have either of those options, but Father's Sins is craftable and comes from the Witch Queen DLC. Certainly obtainable."

Lead from Gold is a very fun build and this could be a great major / champ killer. Compulsive Reloader and Voltshot would make a great pairing and clear rooms quickly. Not quite as strong as Reservoir Burst but an interesting arc alternative.\n\nOver in the Crucible void mains will be happy. Under Pressure and Elemental Capacitor will make this weapon feel like it doesn't move. Another incredible combo would be Under Pressure and Kickstart. Pair those two with heavy investments into charge time and you will have a 336ms anti-shotgun. This might almost fire so quickly you won't be able to precharge as often or aim as well. Another issue is you have to be sliding which on MnK you can slide180 our controller players will not be able to as reliably. Making this lean more towards one input over another."

Jorum's Claw is a fun pulse that needs Arrowhead Brake to even be considered useful. In PvE you really don't have a lot of choice. Outlaw and Arrowhead Brake are required. A mag extending perk is useful but not required. Frenzy does limit the need for outlaw but there aren't really a lot of perks in that column I would take. Golden Tricorn has become one of my favorite perks to recommend for the sheer damage coupled with our current surge mods.\n\nIn PvP you're really looking for consistency. The adaptive frame pulse rifles can two-burst with any damage bonus. This makes Kill Clip highly sought-after but having a more neutral pulse and surge mods can make this weapon also two-burst. With one surge mod you can two-burst all the way up to 7 resilience. Requiring all headshots. With two surge mods you can two-burst up to 8 resilience. 9 resilience with all three surge mods. Tier 10 will never get two bursted without Kill Clip but it's nice to know if your RNG doesn't favor you."

            "description": "Marsilion-C is an interesting grenade launcher. It doesn't do anything special to set itself apart from other grenade launchers in its class but it is craftable. Meaning you can create your 5/5. If you like pure damage you can roll with Field Prep for faster reloads and more reserves and your choice of damage perks. Full Court for longer ranged damage phases, Explosive Light stacked with surge mods, and Vorpal for plain Jane damage. Or you can invest more into add clear with Envious Assassin to overflow the magazine (also good for quicker damage phases) and Incandescent for 'splosions!\n\nIn the crucible you might want a different grenade launcher. Perpetual Motion is the best in slot for column three and Impulse Amplifier is the best for Column four. On other grenade launchers like Memory Interdict you can roll Impulse Amplifier with a better fourth column perk for either damage or consistency. Marsilion-C is great if you don't have a grenade launcher for PvP but I would not rely on it being the best."

Mindbender's in PvE sits in an interesting position, it can get adept mods for more oomph, but it also doesn't roll grave robber to make the use of One-Two Punch. Pugilist is great for more melee energy on Warlocks but not every class needs more melee energy.\n\nIn PvP it might be a tough sell, Aggressive Frames are not the strongest right now. That and you really only need Threat Detector or Surplus to bring up the handling past your barrel and masterwork. There are not a lot of good perks in the fourth column to really let this shotgun shine over something like A Sudden Death."

            "description": "Nameless Midnight is back...again. Fourth Third time's the charm? I am happy to announce that your year 2 version is just as good as this version, this one can just be infused up to max light. Triple Tap and Outlaw are staples, and this can be \"new and exciting\" with Frenzy or Kinetic Tremors instead of Explosive Payload. Kinetic Tremors is perfect for GMs or higher tiered content where you can shoot a champion or major and damage the smaller enemies around them.\n\nIn PvP I don't know if I can really recommend a precision frame. Their time to kill is not great in the current meta and without Box Breathing like Hung Jury SR4 it cannot three-tap with as much ease. You can roll Kill Clip for those three-taps. Perpetual Motion is great for bringing up some of Nameless Midnight's lackluster stats."

I promise Hunter's want to run around with gorilla swords and Titans want ninja-mode. Warlocks just want more books swords too. I digress, over to the recommendations. Relentless Strikes for PvE is just bread and butter. Whirlwind Blade is the bread to Relentless Strikes' butter. It's a tale as old as Vanilla. However, Valiant Charge is incredibly fun in my testing and speed-runners or strike speed-runners might find some good use for this.\n\nIn PvP Valiant Charge and Energy Transfer are perfect together. Blocking gives you class ability energy and the zoomies. Enjoy :)"

I would love to add this shotgun to my arsenal.\n\nIn PvP not having even Surplus for handling is a bit of a bummer. Your only way of increasing your handling is perks itself and dexterity mods.

But the perk pairing I am most excited to try out is Dragonfly and Destabilizing Rounds. I would love to see if the Dragonfly damage causes the volatile to explode meaning one shot can wipe out groups with ease. I would love to add this shotgun to my arsenal.\n\nIn PvP not having even Surplus for handling is a bit of a bummer. Your only way of increasing your handling is perks itself and dexterity mods. A lot is going to have to go into this shotgun to make it usable. Opening Shot doesn't make up for the lack of handling."

It stays above its competition by maintaining a good neutral stat spread and Target Lock. Arrowhead is great with a counterbalance mod for keeping the recoil nice and tight. Zen Moment is a great perk if you want to reduce flinch, especially useful now that Target Lock resets when you miss one shot. Being able to accurately hit your target is especially important on top of 600 autos having seen their day in the sun and need help."

Using your mod slot on a counterbalance mod means you're giving up on damage through a backup mag or spec mod. Compulsive Reloader is the only good reloader perk which can pair wonderfully with Voltshot or Kill Clip. Frenzy is a great neutral option that can or can't make use of Compulsive Reloader.\n\nIn PvP you can run a counterbalance mod or Arrowhead Brake if you prefer a different mod. Keep Away is the in slot and paired with Headseeker you will have a great neutral pulse rifle. If you get the jump on someone you'll have the bonus range and a near perfect first burst. They turn on you, start flinching you, headseeker then comes into play to keep you on that two-burst. Kill Clip is another viable option for a more forgiving two-burst after your first kill, especially when paired with Tunnel Vision. Elemental Capacitor will only accentuate the neutral game of this pulse no matter what subclass you use. Whatever you use this pulse will be a great addition to any vault."

It's like a better Auto-Loading Holster if you have a great add-clearing weapon to pair with it. This will always be your go to.\n\nIn PvP not actually having Auto-Loading Holster or Slideshot is a bummer. You won't always be going on streaks with your primary between grenade launcher shots, and not reliably having a way to reload the gun without it being manual will make things feel clunky compared to other grenade launchers."

It is a precision frame for allowing bow blinting but doesn't have a lot to really bump up Raconteur by itself. You can roll Gutshot Straight to make the bodyshot damage go up and pair it with a 120 hand cannon to body shot with the bow and headshot with the 120. Archer's Tempo is helpful if you lane with Raconteur. Entirely up to you how you want to shape this bow, it's underwhelming at but usable at worst."

It can either clear some adds or deal some great damage.\n\nIn PvP there are not a lot of interesting rolls for grenade launchers. You can roll Proximity Grenades for really reliable OHKs. Rangefinder makes the trajectory faster and Disruption Break can also help if you splash someone instead of getting that OHK, swapping to your kinetic for a 50% damage bonus. This can also help in 6s as any of your teammates get the 50% damage bonus after you break their shield. Helpful if you can coordinate with your team but also a nice bonus if you get it going."

None of these are uncommon on other rockets within the last few seasons.\n\nA similar story in PvP.

            "description": "What a happy little surprise to bless my smol paws. I don't have to grind Moon bounties to get a Kill Clip 120? And it's craftable for all those bonuses and longer Kill Clip? I love it! Keep Away is an incredible perk on 120s as they unusually duel on the end of hand cannon ranges. Killing Wind is also great paired with Kill Clip. You could also opt for Opening Shot for maximum range on that first shot or as a clean up from a long range sniper body shot.\n\nIn PvE Subsistence with Golden Tricorn will be your bread and butter for never ending shooting and a huge damage buff. This works with a build that ability loops by itself like Heart of Inmost Light. If you can keep up Golden Tricorn 2x constantly you will have an incredibly high damage hand cannon. Envious Assassin is an interesting perk as you'll need to swap off your primary to get kills to overflow your magazine to swap back to your primary. If you are running double primary weapons in higher end content or just like to switch up weapons for clearing rooms you will love this perk. However, I just find it odd to need to swap off your primary to overflow your primary."

Grave Robber with Pugilist is a great combo, and you can also roll with Lead from Gold if you want to double stack special weapons. Royal Executioner would pair really well with either a Disorienting Grenade Launcher or a pure DPS shotgun like Heritage.\n\nOffhand Strike is perfect when attached with Killing Wind for better range, stability, and handling all at the same time. Arrowhead Brake is perfect for bringing up the recoil direction. You can drop down the charge time to make shotgun rushers mald. Successful Warmup is great if you want a more traditional fusion rifle experience. Slickdraw will bring up your handling so you can invest entirely into range. Firmly Planted and Elemental Capacitor will make the single shot experience feel great."

Target Lock will deal great damage but Paracausal Affinity is going to be the play, especially if you invest into Strand. Hatchling is also fun if you invest into Strand more for the Threadlings for damage.\n\nIn PvP Target Lock is going to be your best friend. Tap the Trigger and Perpetual Motion are great for bringing up the average stability and handling. If you are accurate with this gun you might find the best use in Target Lock. I am sure this weapon will see less use if Target Lock gets a targeted nerf but we will have to see in the coming weeks."

Target Lock will deal great damage but Paracausal Affinity is going to be the play, especially if you invest into Strand. Hatchling is also fun if you invest into Strand more for the Threadlings for damage.\n\nIn PvP Target Lock is going to be your best friend. Tap the Trigger and Perpetual Motion are great for bringing up the average stability and handling. If you are accurate with this gun you might find the best use in Target Lock. I am sure this weapon will see less use if Target Lock gets a targeted nerf but we will have to see in the coming weeks."

            "description": "Boy do I love these Omolon sidearms. They just feel so good to use. Omolon Fluid Dynamics aside, these have always been one of my favorite classes of sidearms. Being that Senuna SI6 is stasis, the best perk for it is Headstone. Being able to slow and deal AoE damage off of a single kill is extremely strong. We all know how strong Disorienting Grenades are. Slow is just a different version of that. I don't have to tell you all that. Feeding Frenzy is your best bet if you are \"maining\" this sidearm, but Envious Assassin could be fun. I don't love it on primary ammo weapons as you should be using these the most, but depending on your build you could be swapping more than me. Another great perk to look out for is Golden Tricorn. Less useful if you don't use Stasis, but extremely strong now with our current surge mods.\n\nSenuna SI6 is arguably the best three-burst sidearm. Slickdraw gives you 100 handling. A counterbalance mod gives you 99 recoil direction. You can then invest entirely into range as Omolon Fluid Dynamics will give you your stability. The only issue is the fourth column perk. Headstone is great in 3v3. Elemental Capacitor can bump up your stability on void, or forgo a counterbalance mod on Stasis. If you jump a lot then Strand could be a great option for you. Headseeker is another good option. Ideally I would run Headstone just for locking down that position and having some cover as well. Certainly a gun I will farm for and then throw in my vault to use on random loadout shenanigans."

Kill Clip is interesting as if your magazine is overflown you cannot reload for Kill Clip's bonus. I would take Envious Assassin as a nice bonus but not a feature you rely on. Target Lock is nice but a quick 25% damage bonus immediately is nice.\n\nSlickdraw is an incredibly strong perk and this is the first submachine gun with it. You can invest entirely on range without having to worry about handling or using Peacekeepers. Target Lock is the perk of the season so definitely go out and throw this on against Immortals (Adepts). Kill Clip is another good bet if you want a more reliable damage bonus."

            "description": "PvE: Speedy reloads and threadlings? Heck yeah boi. Definitely go for Arrowhead Brake so you have a decent recoil direction. Lightweight scouts don't need much but anything helps. Tactical Mag or Appended Mag are going to be the best here. Small shout out to Flared Magwell, but with Outlaw you won't need a lot of reload. I'd take more bullets for this one.\n\nPvP (Controller): Moving Target is arguably the best in slot for the third column, and kill clip will allow for some spicy three taps. Definitely keep an eye out for this one. Again Arrowhead Brake is recommended for allowing you to focus less on controlling the recoil and more about crits. Steady Rounds will bump up the stability meaning you have less jump each shot. You shouldn't have to worry about the range drop as scouts have different metrics for range. Handling or stability for masterwork depending on how fast you like your weapons.\n\nPvP (MnK): Similar to the controller recommendation, except it has Accurized Rounds. You won't necessarily need the range boost, but you don't need the stability boost from steady rounds either. So use that knowledge for what you'd like. There's no bad mag perk other than extended mag."

No Target Lock for a better TtK but having straight damage for a 0.6s TtK is incredible.

Surrounded is the best damage perk for running into a group of enemies, and threat detector just enhances stats. Nothing like immediate damage.\n\nPvP (Controller): This is the best version of the title we have seen. This almost competes with the like of Shayura's Tarrabah, IKELOS and Immortal. No adept mods, not the best range, but having rangefinder is an incredible bonus. Dynamic Sway Reduction is icing on the Title's cake for allowing a smooth shooting experience.\n\nPvP (MnK): The Title doesn't need much to be a powerhouse in this meta. Rangefinder on a 750 is enough. But allowing you to duel multiple enemies within quick succession is another thing entirely. Without offering damage in the way of Kill Clip, the Title does give you Offhand Strike to take on multiple opponents while keeping your strafe speed up. Pairing this with a freehand grip would be my recommendation."

You will be able to have health, class ability energy, and zoomies all by blocking. Certainly a favorite for Stronghold lovers.\n\nIn PvP it's a sword that does a lot of damage to supers but is very slow to use. Tireless Blade will give you the most kills for your ammo and Valiant Charge will help you cover distance or get into cover better."

Rapid Hit is best in slot, Outlaw or Triple Tap are great for a quick reload or extending the magazine. Incandescent will clear groups of enemies, but 180 hand cannons just aren't PvE meta. They do feel fantastic to shoot, I will give them that. Frenzy will bring up your reload so you won't necessarily need a reload perk, and Solar is an easy enough class to keep Golden Tricorn up consistently. Whichever floats your boat.\n\nI am sad that Trust gained such a large perk pool as investing into all range will feel phenomenal. Rapid Hit will bring up your stability. A 180 hand cannon with 33m of range is incredible. You can also roll flinch machines with Opening Shot and Explosive Payload for slightly less range but great chip damage from afar. Depending on if you swap to Trust or feel like it will be your main weapon you can also opt for Eye of the Storm for better dueling, 180s have a slow time to kill so Eye of the Storm will keep your aim assist high at the end of that duel."

Especially if you rock Lead from Gold builds to keep Unwavering Duty as your main add clear weapon.\n\nIn PvP the similarities do not stop there. Unwavering Duty has incredible stats and both Dynamic Sway Reduction and Tap the Trigger for perfect accuracy. You could also roll Incandescent fr some AoE but I wouldn't count on netting a lot of multikills that way."

            "description": "Hammerhead. Hammerhead. Hammerhead. Unwavering Duty is an updated Hammerhead without being a direct reprisal. Firing Line or Focused Fury will be great for damage and being able to roll Subsistence with Killing Tally is the best thing since 21% Delirium. Definitely a great addition to any Guardian's arsenal. Especially if you rock Lead from Gold builds to keep Unwavering Duty as your main add clear weapon.\n\nIn PvP the similarities do not stop there. Unwavering Duty has incredible stats and both Dynamic Sway Reduction and Tap the Trigger for perfect accuracy. You could also roll Incandescent fr some AoE but I wouldn't count on netting a lot of multikills that way."

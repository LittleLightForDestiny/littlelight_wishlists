It might not be as good as pre-nerf No Time to Explain, but it certainly holds its own in our current Meta. Arrowhead isn't necessary with our deterministic recoil, but I found the bursts a bit tighter and easier to control. I like that Vorpal Weapon can be paired with Kill Clip for extra damage against majors and champions. Rapid Hit is a better neutral perk for cleaning up the burst and adding much needed reload speed.\nMasterworks: Stability"

In the crucible you will be taking damage, so getting some extra benefits alongside that is all upsides. Kill Clip doesn't change the time to kill enough to be noticeable unless you hit nothing but headshots. In which case you'll drop down to a 0.60 TtK with 6 crits on Tier 8 Resilience or below. Without Kill Clip on those higher tiered resilience levels you'll need 1 extra bullet, either way it still remains a two-burst as you won't stop the burst mid-burst.\nMasterworks: Range"

Shoot to Loot combined with Firefly will allow you to pick up orbs and ammo from afar.\n\nThe curated roll of Blast Furnace comes with Perpetual Motion and Kill Clip allowing you to bump up your stats by moving and get extra damage on top.

            "description": "Blast Furnace is probably the best feeling 450 aggressive frame pulse. Personally I liked the Meyrin RDL scope as it highlighted targets, but I can understand it wasn't everyone's cup of tea. The best combo that I will be farming for will be Kinetic Tremors and Firefly for AoE on top of AoE. Keep Away also serves as a good reload perk, while also making it easier to get yellow numbers. Shoot to Loot combined with Firefly will allow you to pick up orbs and ammo from afar.\n\nThe curated roll of Blast Furnace comes with Perpetual Motion and Kill Clip allowing you to bump up your stats by moving and get extra damage on top. While I don't believe it's the best roll overall, it does allow for some utility in both PvE and PvP.\nMasterworks: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed"

Both of which come with some incredible rolls. Outside of its frame you have some other strong pulses like the new Relentless or Messenger (Adept). Blast Furnace does have a leg up over recent additions with the combination of Zen Moment and Kill Clip for easy follow-up two burst kills. Outside of S16 Messenger (which might not be possible due to the perk updates) no other aggressive frame pulse has that combination. (Elsie's Rifle also gets this combo but we will talk about that later).\n\nAnother lethal combo is Headseeker and Kill Clip which allows for double damage, the only other pulse to get this combination is Chattering Bone.\nMasterworks: Range"

So Bungie is either testing us to see if they should buff caster frames or trying to get more hands on feedback. I feel like caster frames are a tough one to balance. Give them too much damage and they become an extremely safe pick in everyday play. Lower the ammo requirements and you will inadvertently buff their DPS as you'll have more opportunities to use the heavy attack. Lower their charge time to counterbalance either of those changes and we're back to square one. Chivalric Fire is a great neutral sword that works best on Void subclasses, but you can utilize either orb generation or volatility to great success without committing to Void.\nMasterworks: Impact"

For the moment we can stack extra rounds into the magazine with Augmented Drum and Envious Assassin, and then hot swap over to Spike Grenades and Cascade Point on some Holo-foil rolls. Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots. If you nail just one roll out of all the Edge Transits I would look for Cascade Point and Explosive Light to be able to nuke most majors, champions, and bosses with ease.\n\nThe curated roll for Edge Transit is Envious Assassin and Destabilizing Rounds for some great synergy with Void builds.

Now you'll need to invest heavier into Blast Radius to hit around 65+ in order to reliably OHK a guardian of all resilience levels. Volatile Launch with a Blast Radius MW gets us to 75, High-Explosive Ordinance brings that up to 85 and evens out the hit to velocity from Volatile Launch. Paired up with Impulse Amplifier and you'll hardly notice a difference compared to a max velocity roll without Impulse Amplifier. With the perk shake up I'd personally take Explosive Light in the fourth column to bring the blast radius up to 100 and get some extra explosion damage but Destabilizing Rounds is also good if you're looking for a pseudo-Chain Reaction.\nMasterworks: Blast Radius"

            "description": "Oh how the meme's be meme'ing. Edge Transit used to drop as often as glimmer. We used to be swimming in them, with how often they used to drop. Now we are asking for more drops of Edge Transit. The hottest DPS weapon outside of Cataphract GL3 (Adept). For the moment we can stack extra rounds into the magazine with Augmented Drum and Envious Assassin, and then hot swap over to Spike Grenades and Cascade Point on some Holo-foil rolls. Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots. If you nail just one roll out of all the Edge Transits I would look for Cascade Point and Explosive Light to be able to nuke most majors, champions, and bosses with ease.\n\nThe curated roll for Edge Transit is Envious Assassin and Destabilizing Rounds for some great synergy with Void builds. It's not incredible but if you've never used Cascade Point it's a great place to start.\nMasterworks: Velocity"

            "description": "The extra health added with the 7.3.5 update made a big switch to heavy grenade launcher perks. Now you'll need to invest heavier into Blast Radius to hit around 65+ in order to reliably OHK a guardian of all resilience levels. Volatile Launch with a Blast Radius MW gets us to 75, High-Explosive Ordinance brings that up to 85 and evens out the hit to velocity from Volatile Launch. Paired up with Impulse Amplifier and you'll hardly notice a difference compared to a max velocity roll without Impulse Amplifier. With the perk shake up I'd personally take Explosive Light in the fourth column to bring the blast radius up to 100 and get some extra explosion damage but Destabilizing Rounds is also good if you're looking for a pseudo-Chain Reaction.\nMasterworks: Blast Radius"

I still have my Guillotine and if it wasn't for the titan swords being so silly to run around with I'd still probably be using my Guillotine to this day. If you never got one from Arrivals or didn't get the roll you wanted, this is your time. Double damage perks in the third and fourth columns propell Falling Guillotine to the best sword in the game. Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch. You lose 5% in damage but make up for it in reliability. Another fun option which seems to be trending with the Brave Arsenal is the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds.\n\nThe curated roll of Falling Guillotine having the tried and true combo of Relentless Strikes and Whirlwind Blade gives a nice homage to the god roll of the past. It's still reliable but you're better off looking for a different \"barrel\" and \"magazine.\"\nMasterworks: Impact"

I still have my Guillotine and if it wasn't for the titan swords being so silly to run around with I'd still probably be using my Guillotine to this day. If you never got one from Arrivals or didn't get the roll you wanted, this is your time. Double damage perks in the third and fourth columns propell Falling Guillotine to the best sword in the game. Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch. You lose 5% in damage but make up for it in reliability. Another fun option which seems to be trending with the Brave Arsenal is the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds.\n\nThe curated roll of Falling Guillotine having the tried and true combo of Relentless Strikes and Whirlwind Blade gives a nice homage to the god roll of the past. It's still reliable but you're better off looking for a different \"barrel\" and \"magazine.\"\nMasterworks: Impact"

A better perk would be Demolitionist for a total of 15% ability energy back on kills (10% paired with 5% from the origin trait), or Disruption Break to give your kinetic weapons a nice 50% damage boost. There isn't a lot to be said in column 4 for PvP as most Disruption Break grenade launchers are paired with Auto-Loading Holster in the third column. Wellspring could pair well with Demolitionist for even more ability energy, or Desperate Measures for a damage bonus without needing a weapon kill to start.\nMasterworks: Velocity"

Over-Under is another good shout here to get rid of most players in rifts. I wouldn't mind hearing more Hammerheads in the crucible. At least I'd know where they are.\nMasterworks: Range"

Both make subsequent shots easier to hit so you can achieve that blistering fast TtK. If you don't like the \"gimmick\" of Box Breathing you could try and farm our rolls with Explosive Payload or Cascade Point.

This roll does allow some crispy 3-taps within PvP for a 0.67s TtK. Enlightened Action will just bring up the low handling and make the weapon feel better as you hit targets.\n\nSpeaking of the crucible the curated roll is almost perfect, if you don't like Enlightened Action you could instead opt for No Distractions or Rapid Hit. Both make subsequent shots easier to hit so you can achieve that blistering fast TtK. If you don't like the \"gimmick\" of Box Breathing you could try and farm our rolls with Explosive Payload or Cascade Point. The former adding extra flinch, the latter dropping the TtK to 0.60s but still requiring 3 crits and 1 body shot.\nMasterworks: Handling"

Workhorse PvE scout. If this is your first season playing destiny either as a new light or a returning player, Imperative has one great redeeming factor; damage. Imperative belongs to the high-impact archetype of scouts giving it the slowest firing rate but the highest damage. Pairing that with more damage through Adrenaline Junkie, some AoE damage through Kinetic Tremors or Explosive Payload. All of these will be happily paired with Rapid Hit for the bonuses to the low stability and reload speed. Subsistence and Keep Away both mitigate the low reload speed by bypassing reload entirely or speeding it up, respectively. I'd still recommend Rapid Hit over both as missing a shot is extremely unforgiving with the slower rate of fire. Precision hits are going to be the goal, why not make follow up shot easier while we're at it.\nMasterworks: Handling"

Definitely pick this up this season.\nMasterworks: Handling"

Impulse Amplifier can turn this into a near instant pseudo-grenade launcher shot, but I think most players are going to opt for Beacon Rounds for better tracking and hip-fire usage. The tracking isn't incredible side to side, for when a Dawnblade flies across your screen, but for general strafing the tracking at low levels is great. At higher buffs you can start to get into a groove and be a bit more loose with your aim, but I wouldn't rely heavily on the tracking. Adagio makes Indebted Kindness a reliable two shot, which I think feeds well into Beacon Rounds.\nMasterworks: Velocity"

Explosive Head can stagger those arrow sponges a bit easier but having Rapid Hit or Archer's Tempo there would have been preferred. Disruption break will work best in conjunction with a high damage kinetic weapon like this season's Supercluster slug shotgun. Golden Tricorn will feel great on a combination of subclasses this season with Permeability changing this weapons damage type from void to your selected subclass.

            "description": "Luna's Howl is back and retains its precision frame, while firing at 140 RPM. If you don't have a good Zaouli's Bane or Igneous Hammer with Heal Clip this can substitute. There's no shortage of Incandescent hand cannons. Magnificent Howl changed from needing precision hits to precision kills, this paired with Lucky Pants can dish out incredible damage, and fan refund itself. It could be very good and fun for lower end PvE content.\n\nThe curated roll of Luna's Howl is a great starting point for both PvE and PvP. Eye of the Storm grants accuracy and the aforementioned Magnificent Howl putting in work in low end PvE. As you scale up you might want something like Precision Instrument or Desperate Measures but it won't carry you through a grandmaster nightfall.\nMasterworks: Stability"

            "description": "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map.\n\nThat specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more \"on demand\" perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter.\n\nLet's briefly talk about the curated roll. Midnight Coup's curated roll is Smallbore / Accurized / Outlaw / Kinetic Tremors. This is a nice glow up from the Outlaw / Rampage roll. If you were to get this roll the only downside in PvE would be the magazine and possibly Outlaw. I believe this roll works best in PvE content as that is what made Midnight Coup the legend that it is today.\nMasterworks: Reload Speed"

Especially now that Explosive Payload has been brought back up to not have a resilience check. Moving Target will bring Midnight Coup to a nice even 100 aim assist, the only other gun to achieve this is Eyasluna with Moving Target, any sight, and a targeting adjustor. Pair this with Zen Moment or Opening Shot and you'll have an incredibly strong dueling weapon. Zen Moment makes subsequent shots easier by increasing your flinch resistance, and Opening Shot starting the duel out on the best possible foot. Midnight Coup suffers from below average range, so I would recommend Hammer-Forged Rifling to bring that up, with Zen Moment you won't need to worry about stability as much, but I would stay away from dropping any stats with Full Bore.\nMasterworks: Range"

            "description": "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map.\n\nThat specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more \"on demand\" perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter.\n\nLet's briefly talk about the curated roll. Midnight Coup's curated roll is Smallbore / Accurized / Outlaw / Kinetic Tremors. This is a nice glow up from the Outlaw / Rampage roll. If you were to get this roll the only downside in PvE would be the magazine and possibly Outlaw. I believe this roll works best in PvE content as that is what made Midnight Coup the legend that it is today.\nMasterworks: Reload Speed"

            "description": "If you were to take a roll into the Crucible, I would recommend Moving Target or Explosive Payload in the third column. Especially now that Explosive Payload has been brought back up to not have a resilience check. Moving Target will bring Midnight Coup to a nice even 100 aim assist, the only other gun to achieve this is Eyasluna with Moving Target, any sight, and a targeting adjustor. Pair this with Zen Moment or Opening Shot and you'll have an incredibly strong dueling weapon. Zen Moment makes subsequent shots easier by increasing your flinch resistance, and Opening Shot starting the duel out on the best possible foot. Midnight Coup suffers from below average range, so I would recommend Hammer-Forged Rifling to bring that up, with Zen Moment you won't need to worry about stability as much, but I would stay away from dropping any stats with Full Bore.\nMasterworks: Range"

Outside of the Seventh Seraph Officer's Revolver paired with Lucky Pants there are not many reasons to use a precision frame hand cannon. If you run void subclasses a lot you can take advantage of Golden Tricorn to maximize damage, making these fast firing hand cannons feel way more chunky than they normally are. Rapid Hit will also bring up the already decent reload speed and their exceptional stability. If you feel like you need more range in PvE (which is an already odd thing to task for) you can opt for Keep Away for a continuous reload speed buff and a touch more range.\nMasterworks: Handling"

Fully invested into range your Optative can reach out to 34.66 meters, for the record that is further by over 1 meter than catalyzed Thorn.

You'll only need one magazine booster to hit the fusion cap of 8 shots or you can opt for an even faster firing fusion with Accelerated Coils. Overflow will double your magazine capacity giving you 16 shots, 15 of which will have an extra 20% damage increase.

When Rampage and Outlaw were all we cared about. Things have shifted and more weapons are certainly popular. The only true competition Subjunctive needs to worry about is the Ikelos SMG. Both are arc, but what gives Subjunctive the edge? Golden Tricorn. It's not the highest uptime on Arc but you can chain back to back arc ability kills with some loadouts, this will give Subjunctive a 1.5x damage bonus over the Ikelos (this is without giving the Ikelos a damage perk of its own). Most players spec'ed into Voltshot which will clear rooms easier but have slight difficulties taking down beefier targets. With Golden Tricorn 2x you'll have enough damage to look at enemies and they'll become unalive from sheer admiration, and you'll be able to chunk down majors with ease, Subsistence just keeps the chains rolling.\nMasterworks: Stability"

Then you can choose your column 3 perk from Moving Target for added aim assist and strafe speed when ADS, or Firmly Planted for better accuracy and a slight handling bump when crouched.\nMasterworks: Handling"

Not only was it incredibly strong in PvP being able to nuke a player from across the map, but it also had a long-standing history in PvE being able to destroy majors and auto-reload via Lunafaction Boots / Rally Barricades. Nowadays the combo is a lot less potent.\n\nWe can still make Mountaintop into a formidable weapon and certainly one to chase. Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss. The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills. If you ever wanted Izanagi's Burden in the form of a grenade launcher, Recombination paired with Auto-Loading Holster will be the roll to grab.\n\nThe curated Mountaintop is an interesting roll. Lead From Gold allows you to rock out with a heavy weapon and run double specials. One for All is an easy damage bonus to grab with grenade launchers as the splash damage can hit multiple enemies. There are certainly better perk combos for a double special loadout and even if you wanted to rock One for All, I'd recommend Ambitious Assassin or Overflow to make it easier to use.\nMasterworks: Velocity"

            "description": "Mountaintop will always have a love/hate relationship for the player base. Not only was it incredibly strong in PvP being able to nuke a player from across the map, but it also had a long-standing history in PvE being able to destroy majors and auto-reload via Lunafaction Boots / Rally Barricades. Nowadays the combo is a lot less potent.\n\nWe can still make Mountaintop into a formidable weapon and certainly one to chase. Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss. The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills. If you ever wanted Izanagi's Burden in the form of a grenade launcher, Recombination paired with Auto-Loading Holster will be the roll to grab.\n\nThe curated Mountaintop is an interesting roll. Lead From Gold allows you to rock out with a heavy weapon and run double specials. One for All is an easy damage bonus to grab with grenade launchers as the splash damage can hit multiple enemies. There are certainly better perk combos for a double special loadout and even if you wanted to rock One for All, I'd recommend Ambitious Assassin or Overflow to make it easier to use.\nMasterworks: Velocity"

Take your pick. If you're going Heal Clip I would recommend Incandescent. Target Lock will work best with Overflow and Onslaught with Subsistence.

You can also just go for a full Bait and Switch loadout with a Tusk of the Boar, Forbearance, and Apex Predator! Look at you go, you fully optimized guardian you.\nMasterworks: Velocity"

Bungie decided against magazine extending perks so the best here is Flared Magwell for when you miss and need to reload. Alloy Mag is great if you do run out of ammo and need to reload before another boss fight or after a wipe. In the third column Field Prep brings up the already buffed reserves while also making reloading faster when crouched.

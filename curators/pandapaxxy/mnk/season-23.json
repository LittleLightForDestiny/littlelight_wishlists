            "description": "Our full ritual playlist weapon is an interesting one. Caster frame swords have not been strong since their introduction. So Bungie is either testing us to see if they should buff caster frames or trying to get more hands on feedback. I feel like caster frames are a tough one to balance. Give them too much damage and they become an extremely safe pick in everyday play. Lower the ammo requirements and you will inadvertently buff their DPS as you'll have more opportunities to use the heavy attack. Lower their charge time to counterbalance either of those changes and we're back to square one. Chivalric Fire is a great neutral sword that works best on Void subclasses, but you can utilize either orb generation or volatility to great success without committing to Void.\nMasterworks: Impact"

Workhorse PvE scout. If this is your first season playing destiny either as a new light or a returning player, Imperative has one great redeeming factor; damage. Imperative belongs to the high-impact archetype of scouts giving it the slowest firing rate but the highest damage. Pairing that with more damage through Adrenaline Junkie, some AoE damage through Kinetic Tremors or Explosive Payload. All of these will be happily paired with Rapid Hit for the bonuses to the low stability and reload speed. Subsistence and Keep Away both mitigate the low reload speed by bypassing reload entirely or speeding it up, respectively. I'd still recommend Rapid Hit over both as missing a shot is extremely unforgiving with the slower rate of fire. Precision hits are going to be the goal, why not make follow up shot easier while we're at it.\nMasterworks: Handling"

Impulse Amplifier can turn this into a near instant pseudo-grenade launcher shot, but I think most players are going to opt for Beacon Rounds for better tracking and hip-fire usage. The tracking isn't incredible side to side, for when a Dawnblade flies across your screen, but for general strafing the tracking at low levels is great. At higher buffs you can start to get into a groove and be a bit more loose with your aim, but I wouldn't rely heavily on the tracking. Adagio makes Indebted Kindness a reliable two shot, which I think feeds well into Beacon Rounds.\nMasterworks: Velocity"

Successful Warm-Up gives you a better draw time post-defeat, but has a bit less utility against higher health enemies. Explosive Head can stagger those arrow sponges a bit easier but having Rapid Hit or Archer's Tempo there would have been preferred. Disruption break will work best in conjunction with a high damage kinetic weapon like this season's Supercluster slug shotgun. Golden Tricorn will feel great on a combination of subclasses this season with Permeability changing this weapons damage type from void to your selected subclass.

Outside of the Seventh Seraph Officer's Revolver paired with Lucky Pants there are not many reasons to use a precision frame hand cannon. If you run void subclasses a lot you can take advantage of Golden Tricorn to maximize damage, making these fast firing hand cannons feel way more chunky than they normally are. Rapid Hit will also bring up the already decent reload speed and their exceptional stability. If you feel like you need more range in PvE (which is an already odd thing to task for) you can opt for Keep Away for a continuous reload speed buff and a touch more range.\nMasterworks: Handling"

Kill Clip gives you nostalgia for the Not Forgotten or Luna's Howl days of yore with a 0.67 time to kill.

Fully invested into range your Optative can reach out to 34.66 meters, for the record that is further by over 1 meter than catalyzed Thorn. The drawback is the lower 1.0 s TtK but once you get going with the 0.67 TtK you can destroy any Thorn user. (Food for thought).\nMasterworks: Range"

But for a \"Kinetic\" fusion rifle I think Scatter Signal rivals and possibly beats out Riptide for best in slot fusion. Overflow and Controlled Burst for added damage throughout the magazine. You'll only need one magazine booster to hit the fusion cap of 8 shots or you can opt for an even faster firing fusion with Accelerated Coils. Overflow will double your magazine capacity giving you 16 shots, 15 of which will have an extra 20% damage increase. If you opt for Extended Battery for the 16 total shots you can slot in Major or Boss spec for an additional 7.77% damage to every shot.\nMasterworks: Charge Time"

Lower the charge time as low as it can go or just throw on Kickstart for extra damage and speedier shots. I'd pair that with Perpetual Motion for the bonuses to stability and handling.

Both are arc, but what gives Subjunctive the edge? Golden Tricorn. It's not the highest uptime on Arc but you can chain back to back arc ability kills with some loadouts, this will give Subjunctive a 1.5x damage bonus over the Ikelos (this is without giving the Ikelos a damage perk of its own). Most players spec'ed into Voltshot which will clear rooms easier but have slight difficulties taking down beefier targets. With Golden Tricorn 2x you'll have enough damage to look at enemies and they'll become unalive from sheer admiration, and you'll be able to chunk down majors with ease, Subsistence just keeps the chains rolling.\nMasterworks: Stability"

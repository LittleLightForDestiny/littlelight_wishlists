Even with the deterministic recoil I preferred the base recoil with counterbalance or full send to 100 recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake. Heal Clip and Incandescent are tried and true rolls but you could opt for Frenzy for the big boost to reload and handling. Loose Change with Incandescent can also make you forget about the reload stat, but falls off a bit in higher level content.\nMasterworks: Stability, Reload Speed"

The heavy attack shoots you up while throwing a wave, similar to a wave frame grenade launcher, straight forward. Follow it up with a light attack and you'll aggressively fly forward. Slice is the easiest choice as you lower your targets damage output, nice for being so close and stomp mechanics doing so much damage. Add in Redirection or Surrounded for increased damage. Or Hatchling for better Strandsynergy and some added chip damage with some investments.\nMasterworks: Impact"

The biggest draw with this weapon is Tear which provides Severing on precision final blows aiding your team and yourself. Reciprocity is useful if you're using this to heal teammates getting a very small bump back. Slice allows you to spread even more Sever on initial targets as well as not needing a critical kill depending on the faction could be easier on some than others.\nMasterworks: Reload Speed"

The low zoom meant it felt more like a hand cannon, but could do more damage and two-burst if you were capable. Arrowhead Brake fixes the recoil enough to be manageable in close ranges and accurate in longer engagements. This won't top the records for range but will be sticky within its intended range. Zen Moment and Headseeker are great neutral perks that offer the best for accuracy assistance and some forgiveness in each burst.\nMasterworks: Range"

Magnificent Howl is the only guaranteed way to two-tap, but Desperate Measures and Master of Arms will both adjust your ease of use but none really shift the needle outside of needing one less crit.

Elemental Capacitor will boost your already high stats as nothing was gained or lost from the old version. Explosive Payload is fine for extra flinch but you lose a touch of range. Opening Shot is the easiest to recommend as it's always good. Snapshot Sights is also good neutrally. Magnificent Howl, Desperate Measures, or Master of Arms will all slightly adjust your damage. Magnificent Howl is the only guaranteed way to two-tap, but Desperate Measures and Master of Arms will both adjust your ease of use but none really shift the needle outside of needing one less crit. And it's also not guaranteed because depending on resilience you may need 2 stacks of either to kill all resiliences for 2c1b.\nMasterworks: Range"
